# Manual Coding Analysis: Job Ad #752 (Fitura)

This document contains the manual coding for the "Senior Machine Learning Ops Engineer" position at Fitura.

-   **Assigned Profile:** `AI-Adjacent Software Engineer`
-   **Reasoning:** This is a classic MLOps role. The responsibilities are heavily skewed towards the `Operations & MLOps` category, focusing on creating deployment templates, maintaining production models, and building CI/CD pipelines. While they collaborate closely with data scientists, they are not building the models themselves. Their primary function is to enable and operationalize the work of others.
