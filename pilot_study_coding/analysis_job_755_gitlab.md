# Manual Coding Analysis: Job Ad #755 (GitLab)

This document contains the manual coding for the "Intermediate Machine Learning Engineer, AI Framework" position at GitLab.

- **Assigned Profile:** `GenAI Specialist`
- **Reasoning:** This is a highly specialized role. It does not focus on building user-facing application code, but instead on a very specific part of the GenAI lifecycle: creating the internal frameworks, tools, and infrastructure to evaluate LLMs. The tasks are a deep blend of model understanding, data management, and specialized software engineering for tooling. This is our first clear example of the `GenAI Specialist` profile.
