While it mentions 'generative AI' and 'data science platforms', the core responsibilities are about building and integrating these technologies rather than developing the AI models themselves (Macro-Category B). The role acts as an engineering lead and liaison for the data science community, supporting their innovation. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

The responsibilities listed are predominantly software engineering tasks, with AI/GenAI being the domain of application rather than the core focus of model development. The distinction between software engineering and AI specialization is well-defined in the ad, leading to high confidence in the profile assignment."
