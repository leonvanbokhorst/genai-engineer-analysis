        "rationale": "The job ad focuses exclusively on tasks related to training, evaluating, and providing feedback for AI models, specifically generative AI models learning to code. These tasks fall under Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization), specifically 'Model Development & Fine-Tuning' (1.B.1). There are no tasks mentioned that fall under Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering). Therefore, the role is best classified as a specialist focused on the AI model itself, rather than a software engineer integrating AI into a product or building AI infrastructure. Given the focus on training and evaluation of generative AI, 'ML Specialist (Data Scientist)' is the closest fit, though 'GenAI Specialist' would also be appropriate if it were an option. However, the provided options lean towards 'ML Specialist' for roles primarily focused on model interaction and training data."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the core tasks being related to training and evaluating AI models. However, it is a part-time, freelance role with flexible hours, and the description is somewhat high-level regarding the specific technical depth or the exact nature of the 'systems developer' aspect. It doesn't detail specific technologies or complex software engineering tasks, making it lean heavily towards the specialist side. The confidence is high because the primary function is clear, but not perfect due to the lack of detail on specific technical stacks or the 'systems developer' aspect."
