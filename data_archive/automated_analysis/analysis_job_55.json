        "rationale": "The job description heavily emphasizes traditional software engineering tasks (1.A.1), such as developing features, writing high-quality code, code reviews, and resolving technical issues. While it mentions integrating LLMs and building APIs for generative AI capabilities (1.B.2), the core responsibilities and examples provided lean towards building and maintaining the software product that *uses* these AI features, rather than focusing on the AI model development itself. The role is described as a 'Backend Engineer' and the AI aspects are presented as enhancements to the existing product. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile, where the primary focus is software engineering with AI/ML as a component of the product."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite detailed regarding software engineering responsibilities and provides clear examples of AI integration. The distinction between core AI work and AI-adjacent software engineering is reasonably clear, leading to a high confidence score. A slightly lower score is given because while LLMs are mentioned, the depth of involvement in prompt engineering or model fine-tuning isn't as extensively detailed as the core software engineering tasks."
