While it mentions 'Machine Learning', 'Generative AI', and 'Large Language Models', these appear to be the domain the platform supports, rather than the primary focus of model development itself. The role is about building and operating the infrastructure and software that enables ML/AI, fitting the description of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

The mention of 'Generative AI' and 'LLMs' is present but framed within the context of the platform's purpose rather than deep model development. The role leans heavily towards Macro-Category A (Software Engineering) with support for Macro-Category B (AI Specialization), making the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile a strong fit. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5 due to the slight ambiguity in how deeply the 'understanding of LLMs' translates into practical application beyond platform support."
