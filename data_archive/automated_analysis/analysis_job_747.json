While Generative AI is mentioned, the core focus and the title 'Machine Learning Engineer' suggest a broader ML scope rather than a specialization solely in GenAI. The tasks lean towards applying and integrating ML models (Macro-Category A) with a strong component of model development (Macro-Category B), fitting the 'balanced mix' criteria for a Core ML Engineer."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly states the role is for a Machine Learning Engineer and mentions several traditional ML domains. It also indicates collaboration and end-to-end delivery of AI solutions. However, the ad is quite brief and lacks specific details on the day-to-day tasks or the exact nature of the 'Generative AI' involvement, making the profile assignment a strong inference rather than a definitive match."
