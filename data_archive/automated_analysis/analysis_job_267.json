The tasks involve both software development/integration (1.A.1) and specific GenAI model/framework work (1.B.1). The emphasis on GPT models and frameworks like LangChain points towards a GenAI focus. The mention of building AI expertise also suggests a role that is hands-on with AI technologies rather than just using them as a feature. Therefore, 'Core GenAI Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

The profile assignment is strongly supported by the text. A slightly lower score is given because the ad could have provided more detail on the balance between software engineering and AI specialization tasks, and the specific nature of the 'AI agents'."
