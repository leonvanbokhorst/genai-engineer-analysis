While AI, GenAI, ML, and NLP are mentioned as techniques used by the team, the specific responsibilities listed for this role do not involve developing, fine-tuning, or integrating AI/ML models themselves. The tasks are primarily about building and maintaining the data infrastructure that supports these techniques, aligning with the 'Software Engineer' profile."

While AI/ML/GenAI are mentioned in the context of the team's work, the specific responsibilities for this role are focused on the engineering aspects rather than AI model development. This makes the classification relatively straightforward, though the mention of AI techniques by the team could lead to slight ambiguity if not carefully distinguished from the role's direct responsibilities."
