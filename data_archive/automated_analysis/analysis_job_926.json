        "rationale": "The job ad heavily emphasizes traditional software engineering tasks such as developing real-time and embedded applications, system integration, and code optimization. While it mentions working with LLM, AI technologies, and artificial intelligence, these are listed as areas to work with rather than the primary focus of model development or specialization. The core responsibilities are rooted in software engineering, with AI/ML being an integrated component rather than the central theme. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines a software engineering focus with an integration of AI/ML technologies. The distinction between core software engineering tasks and the mention of AI is clear. However, the 'junior' aspect and the broad mention of 'AI technologieën' without specific generative AI tasks prevent a perfect score. The classification of AI technologies as 'Data Engineering & Management' is a best fit given the lack of specific GenAI or ML model development tasks mentioned."
