While there's a mention of implementing solutions and keeping up with research, the core responsibilities are focused on the 'B' category tasks of AI specialization, specifically in the GenAI domain. There is no mention of traditional software engineering tasks (Macro-Category A) like building production-grade applications, microservices, or CI/CD pipelines. Therefore, the role is best classified as a GenAI Specialist."
