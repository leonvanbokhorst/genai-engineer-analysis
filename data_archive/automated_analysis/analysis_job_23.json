The `CODING_BOOK.md` defines task categories (Macro-Category A and B) that are specifically related to AI/ML development, integration, or operations. The provided text contains no phrases that can be mapped to any of these defined tasks, technologies, or soft skills. Therefore, the role, as presented, does not fit any of the AI/ML-focused profiles. The `Not Relevant` profile is the most fitting because the ad lacks any 'significant tasks related to either `Core Software Engineering` or `GenAI Specialization`' as defined by the coding book's AI/ML context."

        "reasoning": "The job advertisement is extremely minimal, containing only a job title. There is no descriptive text about responsibilities, technologies, or required skills. This lack of information makes it impossible to perform a meaningful analysis against the detailed `CODING_BOOK.md`. The classification is based on the *absence* of relevant information, which is highly unreliable."
