While it mentions 'cutting-edge generative AI capabilities' and staying at the forefront of 'technical (Gen) AI advancements', the core focus remains on building and integrating these AI solutions into client-facing products and internal tools, rather than deep model development or specialized GenAI tasks like prompt engineering or RAG. The role is primarily about applying AI within a software engineering context to solve business problems and enhance existing workflows, fitting the profile of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

It doesn't delve deeply into specific GenAI techniques or traditional ML model building, making the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile a strong fit. However, the mention of 'Gen AI' and 'innovative tools' could imply a slightly deeper engagement with AI technologies than a purely 'Software Engineer' role, hence a score of 4 rather than 5."
