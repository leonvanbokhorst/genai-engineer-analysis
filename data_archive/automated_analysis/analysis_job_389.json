While it mentions AI/model-based solutions and experimentation with new technologies, the core responsibilities are centered around the development and integration of these solutions into a broader application and data platform, rather than deep model development or specialization in GenAI techniques like prompt engineering or RAG. The role is about building and integrating AI, not solely focusing on the AI models themselves."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about its core responsibilities, leaning heavily towards software engineering with AI integration. However, it doesn't explicitly mention Generative AI specific tasks or tools, making it slightly less definitive for a 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile. The classification as 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is strongly supported, but a perfect score would require more explicit mention of GenAI technologies or tasks."
