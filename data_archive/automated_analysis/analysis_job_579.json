        "rationale": "The job advertisement focuses exclusively on traditional backend software engineering tasks such as developing scalable cloud-native systems, implementing backend systems, working with APIs and network protocols, and ensuring test coverage and documentation. While it mentions 'LLM mission-critical applications', the core responsibilities described do not involve the development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or specialized data handling for GenAI models themselves. The role is about building the platform that *supports* these applications, not building the AI features within them. Therefore, it aligns best with the 'Software Engineer' profile."

The mention of LLM applications is in the context of the platform being built, not the direct development of AI models or features. This clarity makes the classification straightforward."
