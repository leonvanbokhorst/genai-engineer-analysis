        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on integrating ML models into deployable Python applications, which aligns with Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering). While ML models are mentioned, the core tasks described are about the software engineering aspects of deployment and collaboration (design reviews, code reviews, documentation). There are no specific tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). Therefore, the role is classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, as it involves building software that utilizes AI/ML but doesn't focus on the AI/ML specialization itself."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the core responsibilities being software development and integration, with a strong emphasis on collaboration and code quality. The mention of 'ML models' is present but not detailed, suggesting they are components to be integrated rather than the primary focus of development. The profile assignment is straightforward based on the clear distinction between software engineering tasks and AI specialization tasks."
