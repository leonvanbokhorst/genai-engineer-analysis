        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on 'MLOps' and 'creating innovative-scalable-data driven solutions' and implementing them across the organization. While it mentions 'data-driven solutions' and 'Analytics', it does not specify any tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). The emphasis is on the engineering and operational aspects of deploying and managing data-driven solutions, which aligns with Macro-Category A. The role appears to be about building and integrating these solutions rather than developing the core AI models themselves. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile, which is predominantly Macro-Category A with the integration of AI/ML features."

        "score": 3,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is somewhat vague regarding the specific AI/ML technologies or models involved. While 'MLOps' and 'data-driven solutions' are mentioned, there's a lack of detail on the actual AI/ML tasks (e.g., model building, specific algorithms, GenAI focus). This makes it harder to definitively classify the AI specialization aspect, leading to a moderate confidence score."
