There are no specific tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). The role is about building the software that *uses* AI, rather than developing the AI itself. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software development responsibilities with a mention of AI applications. However, it lacks specific details about the AI technologies or the depth of AI involvement, making it slightly less definitive than an ad detailing specific ML/GenAI tasks. The focus is clearly on the 'Full Stack' and 'Cloud' aspects."
