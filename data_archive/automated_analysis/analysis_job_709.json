While there are tasks related to AI model fine-tuning and improving AI systems (1.B.1, 1.B.2), the primary framing is around customer support and integrating AI capabilities into an existing support structure (1.A.1). The role is not building generative AI products but rather enhancing an AI-augmented support system. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile, where AI/ML is a component of the software product being worked on."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to AI systems and their improvement, but it frames them within a technical support context. The tasks lean towards enhancing existing AI capabilities within a support function rather than core AI development or GenAI specialization. The profile assignment is reasonably confident, but the role's exact nature (more SE focused vs. more AI focused) could be slightly ambiguous without more context on the 'AI systems' mentioned."
