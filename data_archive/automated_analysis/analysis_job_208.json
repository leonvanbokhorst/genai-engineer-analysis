While it mentions building tools powered by NLP and ML (1.B.1) and leveraging AI tools, the core responsibilities and the primary language (Java) point towards a software engineering role that incorporates AI as a feature or tool to enhance its functionality, rather than a role focused on deep AI model development or specialization. The emphasis is on building software that *uses* AI, not necessarily on creating or deeply specializing in AI models themselves."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly states the primary technology (Java) and outlines several core software development tasks. The AI components are mentioned but are framed as tools or features to be integrated into the software. The distinction between AI-Adjacent Software Engineer and Core GenAI Engineer is clear based on the emphasis on traditional software engineering with AI integration, rather than deep AI model work. A slightly lower score is given because the AI aspects are described broadly ('tools powered by NLP and ML', 'cutting-edge AI tools') without specifying the nature of the AI work beyond integration."
