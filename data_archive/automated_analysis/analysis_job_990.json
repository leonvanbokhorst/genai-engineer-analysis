        "rationale": "The job ad primarily seeks an experienced software engineer to apply their coding expertise to train AI models. While it involves AI model training, the core emphasis is on leveraging existing software engineering skills ('lend your coding expertise') for this purpose, rather than deep AI research or model architecture design. The role is described as providing 'human feedback' to improve AI models, suggesting an integration or application of software engineering principles within an AI context, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."
    },
    "confidence": {
        "score": 3,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite brief and focuses heavily on the freelance/contract nature and payment details. While it mentions 'software engineer' and 'train AI models', it lacks specific details about the day-to-day tasks, technologies used, or the depth of AI involvement. This makes it challenging to definitively classify the role beyond a general adjacency to AI. The mention of 'generative AI models' and 'write better code' hints at GenAI, but the core task description is broad."
