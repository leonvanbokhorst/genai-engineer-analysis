        "rationale": "The job ad heavily emphasizes tasks related to Generative AI, specifically focusing on foundational model training, data collection for LLMs, inference strategies, model alignment, and evaluation methodologies. While there's mention of 'architecting and developing the distributed training and data processing infrastructure' and 'optimizing training and inference infrastructure', these are framed within the context of supporting LLM development rather than general software engineering. There are no explicit mentions of traditional ML tasks or general software development outside the AI context. Therefore, the role is best classified as a GenAI Specialist."
