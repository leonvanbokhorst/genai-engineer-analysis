While there's mention of 'AI model fine-tuning sessions' (Macro-Category B), the primary emphasis is on the application and improvement of AI within a support system rather than core AI model development or GenAI specialization. The role is about using AI to enhance a service, making it an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

The distinction between core AI development and application/integration is evident. The confidence is high, but not perfect, as the 'fine-tuning' aspect could lean slightly more towards B, but the overall framing is A-dominant."
