While it mentions the 'adoption of ML/GenAI' and analyzing threats to develop strategies (which could involve ML), the core responsibilities and emphasis are on building and operating software systems with a security focus. There is no indication of deep involvement in model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, where AI/ML is a component integrated into the software systems being built and secured, rather than the primary focus of model creation."

The profile assignment is based on the strong emphasis on software development and integration, with AI/ML being a supporting element. A higher score would require more explicit details about the ML/GenAI components of the role."
