The core tasks involve advising clients, gathering requirements, and configuring a software platform, all while leveraging AI. There is no mention of developing or fine-tuning AI models themselves (Macro-Category B). The role is about integrating AI capabilities into the delivery of consulting services, which aligns with the definition of an 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' as someone who builds or maintains software that directly uses or supports AI/ML models as a core part of its functionality, where the output is an AI-powered feature or system (in this case, AI-enhanced consulting services)."

It explicitly states 'Coding or programming' is NOT what they are looking for. The tasks clearly fall into applying AI to business processes and client interaction. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the term 'Implementation Engineer' could sometimes imply deeper technical system building, but the detailed description clarifies the focus is on the application of AI within a consulting framework."
