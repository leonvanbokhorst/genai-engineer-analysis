        "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on front-end engineering tasks (exposing functionality, building interfaces, ensuring customer adoption) which fall under Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration). While it mentions 'generative AI' as the technology concept, the core responsibilities described are about building the user-facing application and integrating the AI functionality, rather than developing or fine-tuning the AI models themselves (Macro-Category B). The role is about making AI accessible to customers through the front-end, aligning with the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly defines the role as 'Front End Developer' and outlines responsibilities related to building user interfaces and integrating functionality. While it mentions 'generative AI', the focus remains on the software engineering aspect of exposing this technology to customers. The lack of specific AI/ML model development tasks or technologies prevents a higher score, but the core software engineering responsibilities are clear."
