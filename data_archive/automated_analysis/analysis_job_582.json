        "rationale": "The job ad clearly outlines a mix of core software engineering tasks (building tools, maintaining production systems, code reviews) and AI specialization tasks. Specifically, 'Fine-tune AI/ML models' and 'Build vehicle assistant response quality evaluation tools' point towards AI/ML model work. The mention of 'data pipelines' also suggests data engineering. While not explicitly mentioning Generative AI terms like LLMs or RAG, the nature of a 'vehicle assistant' and 'response quality' strongly implies interaction with generative models. The balance of tasks leans towards both software engineering and AI specialization, with the AI specialization likely being in the GenAI domain given the product context. Therefore, 'Core GenAI Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the types of tasks involved, blending software engineering with AI/ML model work. However, it lacks explicit mention of specific Generative AI technologies (like LLMs, RAG, etc.), which would have made the classification to 'Core GenAI Engineer' completely unambiguous. The confidence is high due to the clear task descriptions but not perfect due to the absence of explicit GenAI keywords."
