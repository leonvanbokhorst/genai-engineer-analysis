        "rationale": "The job title explicitly states \"Back End Developer\", indicating a primary focus on software engineering tasks (1.A.1. Software Development & Integration). The \"AI Trainer\" component is too vague to assign to a specific AI task category from the coding book, as it lacks details on the type of AI or the specific responsibilities. Therefore, the role is classified as AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, suggesting a software engineering role that integrates or supports AI functionalities."
