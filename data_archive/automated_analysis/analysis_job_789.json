While it mentions advising on 'generative AI' and 'business rule engines', these are presented as areas for exploration and advice rather than core development tasks. The primary responsibilities are rooted in data engineering and software development, with AI/GenAI being an advisory or emerging technology aspect, not the central focus of the role's output. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer who builds or maintains software that uses or supports AI/ML features."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines core data engineering and software development tasks. The mention of generative AI is advisory, not a primary development focus. The role is clearly within the software engineering domain, making the profile assignment straightforward. A slightly lower score is given because the depth of AI/GenAI involvement isn't fully detailed, but the overall software engineering nature is clear."
