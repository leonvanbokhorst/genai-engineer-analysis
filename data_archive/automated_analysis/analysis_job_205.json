While AI is mentioned as the domain of the products (TeachTap, TeachTales, TimeBack, Athena), the core responsibilities described for the engineer do not involve developing, fine-tuning, or integrating AI models themselves. The role is about building the software *around* the AI, rather than building the AI components. Therefore, it aligns best with the 'Software Engineer' profile, which is characterized by tasks exclusively from Macro-Category A and no significant AI/ML model development or integration tasks."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software development tasks and mentions AI as the product domain. However, it lacks specific details about the AI technologies or how they are integrated, making it impossible to classify any tasks under Macro-Category B. The focus is unequivocally on software engineering."
