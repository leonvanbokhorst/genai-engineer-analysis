There are no tasks related to the development, fine-tuning, or specific application of generative AI models (like prompt engineering or RAG). The role is about building software that *uses* AI, rather than building the AI itself."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is very clear about the nature of the tasks involved. While it uses the term 'AI-First' and mentions 'AI-driven innovations,' the specific responsibilities listed are all firmly rooted in traditional software engineering practices, with the integration of AI as a feature. There's no ambiguity about building AI models themselves. The language is direct and leaves little room for interpretation regarding the core duties."
