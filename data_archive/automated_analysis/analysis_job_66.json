While the company's domain is AI/LLM and the product involves AI assistants, the specific responsibilities listed for the engineer are centered on building the software infrastructure and user interfaces that support these AI capabilities, rather than developing or fine-tuning the AI models themselves or performing advanced prompt engineering. This aligns with the definition of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer who builds software that directly uses or supports AI/ML models."
