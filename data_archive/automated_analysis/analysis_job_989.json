While it mentions 'software engineer' in the introductory sentence, the core responsibilities described fall under the 'GenAI Specialization' macro-category (Macro-Category B), specifically 'Model Development & Fine-Tuning'. There are no tasks related to traditional software development (Macro-Category A) or core software engineering practices. Therefore, the 'GenAI Specialist' profile is the most appropriate fit."

Although it mentions 'software engineer' in the title, the detailed responsibilities leave no ambiguity about the nature of the work being focused on AI model training rather than general software development or integration."
