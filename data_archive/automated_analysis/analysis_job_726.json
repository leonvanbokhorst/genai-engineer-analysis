While it mentions 'Big Data Analytics' and 'architecture and design', there is no mention of specific AI/ML models, generative AI, or related tasks like model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. The role is primarily about demonstrating and integrating a data platform, aligning with the 'Software Engineer' profile which focuses exclusively on Macro-Category A tasks without AI/ML model integration."

However, it does not contain any specific mentions of AI/ML models or generative AI tasks, making the classification straightforward. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the term 'Big Data Analytics' could sometimes be associated with ML, but in this context, it's framed as advisory on architecture and design rather than model building."
