        "rationale": "The job ad clearly outlines a blend of core software engineering tasks (1.A.1) such as designing, developing, and maintaining systems, documenting, and collaborating with product owners. Simultaneously, it heavily emphasizes Generative AI specialization (1.B.2) through the explicit mention of utilizing generative AI for products, RAG, Agents, and specific LLMs like GPT-X and Claude. There's also a significant component of data engineering (1.B.3) related to AI/ML. The balance between these two macro-categories, with a clear focus on Generative AI technologies, points to the 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile."
