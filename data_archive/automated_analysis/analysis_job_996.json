        "rationale": "The job advertisement focuses almost exclusively on tasks related to training, evaluating, and interacting with generative AI models to improve their performance, particularly in code generation. While the role is described as being for an 'experienced software engineer', the core responsibilities (1.B.1) are centered on AI model specialization rather than software development and integration (Macro-Category A). There are no explicit mentions of building software applications, MLOps, or integrating AI into existing systems. The emphasis is on the AI model's learning process itself, making 'GenAI Specialist' the most fitting profile."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the tasks related to AI model training and evaluation. However, it is a bit light on specific technical details or the exact nature of the 'software engineering' background desired, which prevents a perfect score. The core AI tasks are well-defined, leading to high confidence in the profile assignment."
