While it mentions building and integrating these solutions into applications (Macro-Category A), the core of the responsibilities lies in the development and application of ML models and the associated data pipelines (Macro-Category B). There is no mention of Generative AI specific tasks like LLMs, RAG, or prompt engineering. Therefore, the profile is 'Core ML Engineer'."

The distinction between traditional ML and GenAI is evident, and the ad clearly falls into the traditional ML category without any ambiguity. The language used directly maps to the definitions in the coding book."
