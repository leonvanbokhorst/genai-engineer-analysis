        "rationale": "The job advertisement focuses heavily on infrastructure engineering tasks such as administering Kafka, setting up tools in Kubernetes, monitoring systems with Prometheus and Grafana, and improving CI/CD pipelines. It also mentions writing tools and services in Go and Python. While data is central, there are no specific tasks or technologies related to AI/ML model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. The role is about building and maintaining the data platform infrastructure that supports data-driven decisions, rather than developing or integrating AI/ML models themselves. Therefore, it aligns best with the 'Software Engineer' profile, specifically within the data infrastructure domain."

It explicitly mentions technologies and tasks that fall under core software engineering and operations, with no mention of AI/ML specific tasks or models. This clarity makes the classification straightforward."
