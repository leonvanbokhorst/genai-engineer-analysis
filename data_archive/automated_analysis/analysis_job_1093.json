        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on software development tasks such as creating, improving, troubleshooting, maintaining, and updating platforms and tools. While it mentions AI technologies like LLMs and GPT-4 Vision, the primary emphasis is on integrating these into existing systems and providing support for their use, rather than deep model development or specialization. The tasks align predominantly with Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering), with AI integration being a feature of the software being built. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software development and integration tasks related to AI. The language is specific enough to identify the core responsibilities. However, it could be slightly more explicit about the depth of AI involvement beyond integration and support to definitively rule out a 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile, hence a score of 4."
