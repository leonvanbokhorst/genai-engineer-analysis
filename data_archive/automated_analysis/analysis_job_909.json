        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on tasks related to Generative AI, specifically mentioning 'large language models (LLM's)' and tasks like designing and implementing AI solutions based on them, improving text models, and analyzing/preparing datasets for model performance. While there are mentions of testing and optimizing solutions (1.A.2), the core of the role is clearly in the GenAI specialization (1.B.1, 1.B.3). There's also an emphasis on responsible AI application and business context (1.C.1). The role does not appear to be purely a software engineering role integrating AI, nor a specialist role focused solely on model development without software engineering aspects. The blend of designing/implementing LLM solutions and preparing data, alongside operational aspects like testing and optimization, points towards a 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly specifies 'Generative AI engineer' and lists several tasks directly related to LLMs and AI solutions. The Dutch language used for the core responsibilities is understandable in context. However, it lacks explicit mentions of specific technologies or frameworks (like LangChain, Python, etc.) which would have made the classification even more definitive. The soft skills are also somewhat general. Despite this, the core tasks strongly indicate the profile."
