While there's an element of AI improvement (1.B.1), the primary emphasis is on integrating these AI aspects into a broader support function and prototyping new AI tools (1.A.1). The role is not about building AI models from scratch or specializing deeply in GenAI techniques but rather using and enhancing AI to support existing operations. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to AI integration and improvement within a customer support context. The tasks are specific enough to categorize, although the 'AI-Augmented Customer Resolutions' could be interpreted in multiple ways. The emphasis on improving the AI system and fine-tuning sessions leans towards AI specialization, but the core function remains support, making it AI-adjacent."
