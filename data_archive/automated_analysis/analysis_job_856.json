While generative AI is mentioned as an area for exploration, it is not presented as a core responsibility or a primary focus of the role's tasks. The emphasis is on building and integrating software solutions and transforming client environments through engineering best practices. Therefore, the 'Software Engineer' profile is the most appropriate fit."

The mention of generative AI is secondary and framed as an exploration opportunity within a broader software engineering context. This clarity makes the analysis straightforward and highly confident."
