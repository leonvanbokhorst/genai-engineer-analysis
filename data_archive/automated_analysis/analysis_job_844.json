        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on building, maintaining, and optimizing data infrastructure and pipelines (Macro-Category A tasks like 1.A.1 and 1.A.2), using tools like Spark, Python, Azure, Terraform, and Kubernetes. While it supports AI models and involves data processing for them (1.B.3), the core responsibilities are engineering the underlying data systems rather than developing or fine-tuning AI models themselves. There is no mention of Generative AI specific tasks like LLMs, RAG, or prompt engineering. Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, as it builds software infrastructure that enables AI, but is not primarily focused on AI model development or specialization."
