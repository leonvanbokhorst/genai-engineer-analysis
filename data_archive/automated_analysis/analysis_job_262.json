However, the advertisement provides no details about specific tasks or responsibilities. Crucially, there is no mention of any AI or Machine Learning specific responsibilities or technologies. According to the CODING_BOOK.md, the 'Software Engineer' profile is defined as roles where 'Tasks are exclusively from Macro-Category A. The role does not involve building or integrating AI models.' Given the complete absence of AI/ML context in the ad, this profile is the most appropriate classification for the described role."

The classification relies solely on the title 'Intern Python Developer' and the presence of 'Python' as a technology. Therefore, confidence in the analysis is very low."
