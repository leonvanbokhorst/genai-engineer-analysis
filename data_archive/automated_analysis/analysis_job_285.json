        "rationale": "The job ad describes a balanced mix of core software engineering tasks (data pipelines, Linux server management) and AI specialization tasks. Crucially, the AI tasks explicitly mention 'GenAI Suite' and 'Klus Coach (a generative AI assistant)', indicating a focus on Generative AI. The role also involves managing Dataiku projects and supporting data science initiatives, which are AI-related but not exclusively traditional ML. Therefore, the profile is 'Core GenAI Engineer'."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to both software engineering (data pipelines, infrastructure) and AI (GenAI Suite, Klus Coach, Dataiku). The mention of specific generative AI projects makes the classification towards 'Core GenAI Engineer' quite strong. However, the depth of involvement in prompt engineering or model fine-tuning isn't detailed, and the 'Data Engineer' title alongside 'AI Engineer' suggests a blend that could lean slightly more towards infrastructure and data management than pure AI model development. Hence, a confidence score of 4 is appropriate."
