        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on software development tasks (ideate, architect, deploy, design, implement AI-driven applications) which fall under Macro-Category A. While it mentions AI-centric solutions and staying informed on AI technologies, it does not detail specific AI model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG tasks (Macro-Category B). The operational tasks also lean towards system maintenance rather than MLOps. Therefore, the role is best classified as a Software Engineer who integrates AI into applications."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software development and operational tasks with an AI focus. However, it lacks specific details about the AI technologies or methodologies to be used, making it slightly less definitive than a role with explicit AI model building requirements. The mention of 'AI-centric solutions' and 'AI-driven applications' is present but not deeply elaborated."
