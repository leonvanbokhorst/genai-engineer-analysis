Phrases like 'help train AI models', 'train AI large language models', 'Crafting and answering questions related to computer science in order to help train AI models', and 'Evaluating and ranking code generated by AI models' all fall under 'Model Development & Fine-Tuning' (1.B.1). There are no tasks related to software development, integration, or MLOps (Macro-Category A). While the role mentions 'experienced software engineer', the core responsibilities are purely focused on the AI model training aspect, making it a specialist role in this domain. Given the focus on training and evaluating generative AI models, it aligns best with 'ML Specialist (Data Scientist)' as defined in the coding book, even though the models are generative, the *task* is specialized model work."

However, it lacks specific technical tool mentions and doesn't detail the software engineering aspects that might be expected from a more integrated role. The profile assignment is strong based on the described tasks, but the lack of technical specifics prevents a perfect score."
