While it mentions LLMs and specific AI technologies like GPT-4 Vision and Amazon CodeWhisperer, the focus is on integrating and supporting these within existing workflows and infrastructures (AWS). The role is about building software that *uses* AI, rather than deep model development or specialized GenAI tasks. The tasks are predominantly from Macro-Category A, with AI integration being a feature of the software being built, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."
