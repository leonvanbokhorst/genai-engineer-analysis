        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on tasks directly related to training and evaluating generative AI models, such as helping models write better code, creating questions for training, and evaluating generated code. While it mentions software engineering expertise, the core responsibilities are centered around the AI model's learning process rather than building software applications that integrate AI. There are no explicit mentions of software development, integration, or MLOps tasks. Therefore, the role is best classified as a 'GenAI Specialist'."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines tasks related to AI model training and evaluation, strongly indicating a specialist role. However, it's not a 5 because the description is relatively brief and doesn't delve into the specific technical stack or the depth of the AI model interaction beyond the stated tasks. The mention of 'software-engineer' could be interpreted in multiple ways, but the core tasks lean heavily towards AI specialization."
