However, the mention of specific LLM technologies points towards the AI Specialization macro-category. Given the prompt's instruction to classify phrases, and the specific mention of LLM technologies, it leans towards B. However, the action is integration, which is A.1. Reclassifying to 1.A.1 as the primary action is integration."

While it mentions specific AI technologies like GPT-4 Vision and Amazon CodeWhisperer, the primary emphasis is on the software engineering aspects of building and supporting these systems within existing infrastructures (AWS). There is no explicit mention of core model development, fine-tuning, or deep prompt engineering/RAG specific tasks (Macro-Category B). Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, as it involves building software that directly uses AI/ML features."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering responsibilities (create, improve, troubleshoot, maintain, update, integrate, enhance performance, ensure support) in the context of LLMs and AI technologies. The mention of specific AI tools and AWS provides concrete technical context. The primary focus is on the integration and operational aspects of AI within software platforms, aligning well with the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the description could be slightly more explicit about the *depth* of AI model interaction versus the software integration aspect."
