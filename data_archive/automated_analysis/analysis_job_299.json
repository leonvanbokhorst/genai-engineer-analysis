        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on tasks related to training and evaluating AI models ('help train AI models', 'Evaluating and ranking code generated by AI models'). While it mentions 'generative artificial intelligence models', the core activities described are about providing feedback and data for training, which aligns with specialized ML tasks rather than building or integrating AI into software products. There are no explicit software engineering development or MLOps tasks mentioned. The role is described as 'Big Data Engineer for AI Training' and the tasks are centered around the AI model's learning process, fitting the 'ML Specialist (Data Scientist)' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines tasks related to AI model training and evaluation. However, it is somewhat light on specific technical details or the broader software engineering context, which prevents a perfect score. The mention of 'generative artificial intelligence models' is present, but the tasks are more general AI training tasks. The profile assignment is strong based on the described activities."
