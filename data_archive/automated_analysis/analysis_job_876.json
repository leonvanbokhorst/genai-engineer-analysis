        "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on configuring and integrating Salesforce CPQ applications, which falls under 'Software Development & Integration' (Macro-Category A). While AI tools and techniques are mentioned, their application is described as a means to automate tasks and improve existing processes within the software configuration workflow, rather than developing or specializing in AI models themselves. The core responsibility remains software configuration and customer requirement translation, with AI as an enhancement tool. This aligns with the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile, where the role builds or maintains software that uses AI features, but the primary focus is on the software engineering aspect."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the primary responsibilities as configuring Salesforce CPQ, which is a software engineering task. The mention of AI is in the context of enhancing these existing processes. The role does not involve deep AI model development or specialization. The profile assignment is straightforward based on this clear distinction. A score of 4 is given because while the core tasks are clear, the depth of AI involvement is described as 'applying AI tools and techniques' which could be interpreted slightly differently, but the overall emphasis remains on the software configuration aspect."
