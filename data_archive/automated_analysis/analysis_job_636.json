While it mentions building Gen AI solutions, it doesn't detail specific model development, fine-tuning, or prompt engineering tasks (Macro-Category B). The role is primarily about integrating and operationalizing Gen AI within a software engineering context, making 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' the most fitting profile."

However, it lacks specific details on the depth of Gen AI specialization (e.g., specific models, fine-tuning techniques), which prevents a perfect score. The profile assignment is strongly supported by the emphasis on building and running solutions and re-usable components."
