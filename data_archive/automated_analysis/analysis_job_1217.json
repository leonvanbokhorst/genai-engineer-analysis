        "rationale": "The job ad focuses on designing, developing, and optimizing data pipelines and integrating GenAI technologies into analytics workflows, with a supporting role in ML model deployment. While GenAI is mentioned, the core tasks lean heavily towards software engineering (Macro-Category A) with the integration of AI as a feature, rather than deep model development or specialization (Macro-Category B). The collaboration aspect also aligns with a software engineering role that interfaces with AI specialists."

It mentions GenAI and ML models but doesn't detail deep model development or specialization. The profile assignment is strong, but a slightly higher score would be warranted if there were more explicit details on the *nature* of the GenAI integration or specific tools."
