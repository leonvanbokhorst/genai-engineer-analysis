        "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on developing and maintaining applications within the Pega platform, with a specific emphasis on integrating GenAI capabilities into case management. The core tasks are rooted in software development (1.A.1), and while GenAI is mentioned, there's no indication of deep model development, fine-tuning, or prompt engineering (Macro-Category B). The role is about building software that *uses* AI, rather than building the AI itself. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."
    },
    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the primary responsibilities and the technology stack (Pega). It specifies the integration of GenAI into existing systems rather than core AI model development. The profile assignment is quite clear, but the term 'GenAI' is used broadly without specifying the depth of AI involvement, which prevents a perfect score."
