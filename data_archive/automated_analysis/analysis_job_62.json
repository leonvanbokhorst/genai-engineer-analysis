        "rationale": "The job advertisement provides only a title ('Intern - Machine Learning Engineer (LLM)') and a statement about flexible working. No specific job tasks, technologies, or soft skills are detailed. Based on the title, the role is strongly implied to involve both software engineering (Macro-Category A) and Generative AI specialization (Macro-Category B), with a focus on LLMs. Therefore, the `Core GenAI Engineer` profile is inferred as the most probable fit, despite the lack of explicit task descriptions."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 2,
        "reasoning": "The job advertisement is extremely brief and lacks any specific details about job tasks, technologies, or soft skills. The profile assignment is based solely on inferring from the job title, which introduces significant uncertainty regarding the actual responsibilities and the balance between software engineering and AI specialization."
