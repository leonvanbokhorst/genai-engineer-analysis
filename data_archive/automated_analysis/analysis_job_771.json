        "rationale": "The job advertisement heavily emphasizes tasks related to designing methodologies and developing implementations for traditional financial risk models (e.g., Economic capital, Stress test, valuation adjustment models), which fall under '1.B.1. Model Development & Fine-Tuning'. While there is a mention of building 'benchmark libraries' and setting 'best practices' (1.A.1), the core focus and the majority of described responsibilities are centered on model development. The technologies mentioned are Python, and the domain is quantitative finance, not Generative AI. This predominance of 'B' category tasks focused on traditional ML leads to the classification as 'ML Specialist (Data Scientist)'."

The distinction between traditional ML and GenAI is clear as only traditional ML concepts are present. This clarity allows for a confident analysis and profile assignment."
