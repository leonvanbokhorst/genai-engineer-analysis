While 'generative AI' is mentioned, it is framed as an opportunity for experimentation with cutting-edge technologies, not as a core responsibility or required skill for model development or integration. The role's emphasis is on building and improving software systems and engineering culture, aligning with the 'Software Engineer' profile which is exclusively Macro-Category A."
