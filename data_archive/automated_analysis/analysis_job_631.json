        "rationale": "The job ad focuses on building and operationalizing an 'innovation platform' and 'proeven' (experiments/proofs of concept). While 'AI' is mentioned in the title, the description itself emphasizes the development and operationalization of a platform and proofs of concept, which are core software engineering tasks (Macro-Category A). There are no specific tasks mentioned that fall under GenAI Specialization (Macro-Category B), such as model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. The mention of 'AI ontwikkelaar' in the title suggests AI is involved, but the described tasks are primarily about building the infrastructure and operationalizing concepts, fitting the profile of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 3,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is very brief and lacks specific details about the nature of the 'AI' or the 'proeven'. While the tasks described lean towards software development, the explicit mention of 'AI ontwikkelaar' in the title creates some ambiguity about the depth of AI involvement. The confidence is moderate because the core tasks described are software engineering, but the AI aspect is underspecified."
