        "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on traditional data engineering tasks such as designing and managing data architecture, ETL processes, and cloud platform development within Azure. While it mentions collaboration with ML/AI teams and leveraging generative AI, the core responsibilities are centered around building and maintaining the data infrastructure that supports these AI initiatives, rather than developing or fine-tuning AI models themselves. The role is primarily about software engineering (Macro-Category A) with an AI component, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines data engineering responsibilities and mentions AI/ML support, but the core focus remains on data infrastructure and cloud services. The distinction between this role and a core AI/ML role is clear, leading to high confidence in the profile assignment. However, the mention of 'generative AI' in partnership with Microsoft is slightly vague regarding the specific tasks, preventing a perfect score."
