It also involves integrating AI technologies (GPT-4 Vision, CodeWhisperer) into these platforms and providing support for their utilization. While there's mention of AI technologies and LLMs, the core emphasis is on building and maintaining the software infrastructure that *uses* these AI capabilities, rather than deep model development or specialized GenAI research. The tasks are predominantly in Macro-Category A, with AI integration being a key feature of the software being built."
