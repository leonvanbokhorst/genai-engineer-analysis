It also includes understanding of ML algorithms and MLOps best practices (Macro-Category A and B). There is no mention of Generative AI specific tasks like LLMs, RAG, or prompt engineering. The role involves guiding junior developers and working with clients on ML strategies, indicating a balanced mix of A and B, but with a clear focus on traditional ML rather than GenAI."

However, it lacks explicit mention of Generative AI, making the distinction between a Core ML Engineer and an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer slightly less definitive than it could be if GenAI was explicitly excluded or included. The 'AI/ML Full Stack Engineer' title is broad, but the listed technologies and tasks lean heavily towards traditional ML."
