        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on generative AI tasks, specifically mentioning RAGS, LLMs, and vector databases. While it implies delivering value to customers (Business Understanding), there are no explicit mentions of core software engineering tasks (Macro-Category A). The emphasis is on the AI specialization (Macro-Category B) within the generative AI domain, making 'GenAI Specialist' the most fitting profile."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite specific about the generative AI technologies (RAGS, LLMs, vector databases) and the core task of designing and implementing these solutions. However, it lacks detail on the software engineering aspects (integration, deployment, MLOps) and specific programming languages or frameworks beyond the AI-specific ones. This makes it clear it's an AI-focused role but less clear if it's a balanced engineer role or a pure specialist role without more context."
