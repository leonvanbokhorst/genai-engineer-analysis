While it mentions 'integrating AI' and 'real-time data processing', it does not detail any specific AI model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG implementation. The focus is clearly on building a game (software) that *uses* AI, rather than developing the AI models themselves. The role is primarily software development with an AI component, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

The mention of AI is in the context of integration into the game, not in the development of AI models themselves. The tasks listed are overwhelmingly aligned with software development, making the classification straightforward."
