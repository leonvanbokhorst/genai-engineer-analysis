Simultaneously, it highlights the need for Docker, Kubernetes, and AI deployment pipelines, which are core MLOps/LLMOps responsibilities (Macro-Category A). The blend of both software engineering/operations (A) and specific GenAI/ML tasks (B) points towards a 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile, especially with the explicit mention of LLMs and Generative AI."

The combination of these elements strongly suggests a core engineering role with AI specialization. However, it lacks specific details on the *depth* of involvement in each area, preventing a perfect score."
