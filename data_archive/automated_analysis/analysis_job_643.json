While there's an element of AI specialization (fine-tuning, improving AI), the primary focus is on the application and integration of AI within a support system, rather than core AI model development or deep generative AI tasks. The tasks lean more towards using and enhancing existing AI within a software context, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to AI integration and improvement within a customer support context. While it mentions AI model fine-tuning, it doesn't delve into deep AI research or complex model building, making the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile a strong fit. The confidence is high, but not perfect, as the term 'Application Support Engineer' could imply a broader scope, but the detailed bullet points clarify the AI focus."
