        "rationale": "The job description heavily emphasizes traditional software engineering tasks ('Implementing AI from the ground up in projects, enhancing everything from feature development', 'improving software development processes', 'Drive the integration of AI into our development process'). While it mentions AI-generated summaries, the core focus is on integrating AI to enhance existing software and development processes, rather than deep model development or specialization in GenAI techniques. The role is primarily about building software that *uses* AI, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the responsibilities, leaning heavily towards software development with AI integration. The distinction between AI as a 'co-pilot' and 'booster' versus a core focus on AI model building is evident. However, the specific AI techniques (beyond 'AI-generated summaries') are not detailed, which prevents a perfect score."
