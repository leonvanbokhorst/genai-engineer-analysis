These tasks fall predominantly under Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering), specifically 1.A.1 (Software Development & Integration) and 1.A.2 (Operations & MLOps). There are no explicit tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, as it involves building and maintaining the software infrastructure that supports AI capabilities, rather than developing the AI models themselves."
