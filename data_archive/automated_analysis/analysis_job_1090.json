While it mentions 'Generative AI-based features' and 'traditional Natural Language Processing', the core responsibilities and required skills are rooted in software development and integration, with AI/ML being a component integrated into the application rather than the primary focus of model development or specialization. The technologies listed are primarily related to cloud platforms, CI/CD, and specific conversational AI tools (Power Virtual Agents, Copilot Studio), reinforcing the integration aspect."

However, the depth of involvement with Generative AI itself (beyond integration) is not explicitly detailed, making it slightly less definitive than a role solely focused on model building. The mention of 'traditional Natural Language Processing' alongside Generative AI suggests a blend, but the overall framing leans towards application development."
