While ML/GenAI is mentioned in the context of threat detection and data, the core responsibilities do not involve building or fine-tuning ML/GenAI models themselves. The role is about building software that leverages these technologies for security purposes, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job advertisement clearly defines the role as a Senior Software Engineer with a focus on security solutions. The tasks described are predominantly software engineering-centric. The mention of ML/GenAI is contextual to the problem domain (threat detection) rather than specifying ML/GenAI model development tasks for the engineer. The lack of specific technology mentions prevents a perfect score, but the clarity of the core responsibilities allows for high confidence in the profile assignment."
