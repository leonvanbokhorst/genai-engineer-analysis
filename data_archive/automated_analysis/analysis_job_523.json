However, the primary tasks revolve around monitoring robots, drafting process documents, and developing/deploying automations, which are core software engineering activities (Macro-Category A). The AI/ML components are used as tools within this broader automation development context, rather than being the sole focus of model development or specialization. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile, where AI/ML features are integrated into a product (automations)."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines tasks and technologies. The mention of AI/ML/GenAI is present but integrated into a broader automation context. The profile assignment is clear, but the exact balance between 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' and a potential 'Core ML Engineer' (if the AI/ML tasks were more central) could be slightly ambiguous without more detail on the depth of AI/ML involvement. However, the emphasis on 'automations' and 'robots' leans towards software engineering with AI augmentation."
