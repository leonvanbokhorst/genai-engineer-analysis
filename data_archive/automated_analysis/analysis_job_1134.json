        "rationale": "The job description focuses on integrating AI capabilities into customer support systems and improving existing AI systems through feedback and fine-tuning. While there's mention of AI model fine-tuning (1.B.1), the primary emphasis is on applying human expertise to resolve issues where AI falls short and improving the AI system itself, which is a form of integration and enhancement of existing AI tools within a broader application context (1.A.1). There's no indication of building AI models from scratch or deep specialization in generative AI techniques beyond improving existing systems. The role is about supporting and enhancing AI-driven customer resolutions rather than core AI development or research. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to AI system improvement and integration into customer support. While it mentions 'AI model fine-tuning', the overall context suggests a role focused on applying and refining existing AI rather than deep model development or generative AI specialization. The soft skills mentioned also align well with the profile. The confidence is high, but not perfect, as the term 'AI-Augmented Customer Resolutions' could be interpreted slightly differently, but the subsequent points clarify the nature of the work."
