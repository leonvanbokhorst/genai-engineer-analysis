        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to generative AI, proof-of-concept development, and integration into products. It also highlights relevant soft skills. However, it lacks specific mentions of technologies or detailed methodologies, which would have made the classification even more definitive. The distinction between 'AI Specialist' and 'GenAI Scientist' is clear, but the exact balance of tasks could be slightly more detailed."
