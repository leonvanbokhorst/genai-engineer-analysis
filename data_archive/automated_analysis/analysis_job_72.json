The responsibilities focus on participating in architecture design, coding sprints, building AI solutions (like ML Ops), and developing reusable software assets. While it involves Microsoft's AI offerings (Azure ML, Azure OpenAI, etc.), the core tasks are software development and integration, with a data science team partnering for the modeling aspects. This aligns with the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile, where the role builds or maintains software that uses AI/ML features as a core part of its functionality, rather than focusing on the AI model development itself."
