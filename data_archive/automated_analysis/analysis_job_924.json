        "rationale": "The provided job advertisement consists solely of a title ('OPS Engineer C') and contains no descriptive text regarding job tasks, responsibilities, technologies, or required skills. As per the CODING_BOOK.md, profile assignment relies on identifying tasks within Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering) and Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization). The absence of any such information prevents classification into any of the defined AI/ML roles. Therefore, the role is classified as 'Not Relevant' due to insufficient data."

        "reasoning": "The job advertisement is extremely minimal, containing only a title. There is no descriptive content to analyze for tasks, technologies, or soft skills, making a meaningful classification impossible. The confidence score is very low due to the complete lack of information."
