It also includes operational aspects (Macro-Category A: Operations & MLOps) like monitoring and optimization. While it mentions collaboration with LLM engineers and contributing to an AI assistant, the core responsibilities are centered around the data infrastructure that supports AI, rather than the development or fine-tuning of AI models themselves. The integration of security measures (access control, datamasking) also leans towards software engineering. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile as it builds and maintains the systems that support AI, but isn't the primary developer of the AI models."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the responsibilities, focusing heavily on data architecture, pipelines, and operational aspects supporting AI. The mention of 'LLM-engineers' and 'AI-assistent' provides context for the AI focus. The classification into 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is strongly supported by the emphasis on data infrastructure and operations rather than core AI model development. A slightly lower score is given because the ad doesn't explicitly detail the programming languages or specific AI/ML frameworks used, which would have made the classification even more definitive."
