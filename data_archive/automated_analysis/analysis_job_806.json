    "profile": {

        "rationale": "The job ad focuses on a Quality Engineer role within a traineeship. While it mentions the use of Generative AI (ChatGPT, Prompt Engineering, NLP) for tasks like test design and reporting, the primary emphasis remains on traditional software quality engineering practices, including frontend, backend, and API testing. The core responsibilities are rooted in software development and integration (Macro-Category A), with AI/GenAI being a specialized toolset applied within that context. There isn't a significant focus on developing or fine-tuning AI models themselves (Macro-Category B), nor is the role purely focused on AI specialization. Therefore, it fits the profile of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, where AI/GenAI is integrated into a broader software engineering function."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the nature of the role being a traineeship in Quality Engineering with an added focus on Generative AI. The tasks and technologies are well-defined within the context of quality assurance. The profile assignment is straightforward based on the balance of tasks. A score of 4 is given because while clear, the role is a traineeship, which inherently means the depth of experience in AI/ML is developing rather than established, and the primary focus is still on the 'quality engineering' aspect."
