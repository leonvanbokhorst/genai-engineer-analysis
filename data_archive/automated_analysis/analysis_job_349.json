        "rationale": "The job description heavily emphasizes building and evaluating ML models, particularly in NLP, and mentions using LLMs and GenAI. It also includes building ML pipelines for automation and integrating results via microservices. While GenAI technologies are mentioned, the core focus appears to be on the broader ML lifecycle and model development, with a significant component of data preparation and pipeline building. The role also involves collaboration and communicating value, but the primary technical tasks lean towards traditional ML engineering with an application of newer GenAI techniques rather than a sole focus on GenAI-specific tasks like prompt engineering or RAG development. The mention of 'Medior ML engineer / Data Scientist' in the title also supports this classification."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite detailed regarding the tasks and technologies involved. The mention of both 'ML' and 'GenAI/LLMs' is clear, but the emphasis on 'building ML models', 'NLP domain', and 'ML pipelines' suggests a strong foundation in traditional ML engineering, augmented by GenAI. The profile assignment is well-supported by the text, but the explicit mention of LLMs and GenAI prevents a perfect score, as it could be interpreted as leaning slightly more towards GenAI than a purely traditional ML role."
