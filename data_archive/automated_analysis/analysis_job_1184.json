While it mentions 'Big Data Analytics' and a 'Databricks Data Intelligence Platform', there is no explicit mention of Generative AI, LLMs, or specific AI/ML model development tasks. The role is primarily about demonstrating and integrating a data platform, which aligns with building or maintaining software that uses data capabilities, rather than specializing in AI model development itself. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile as it involves technical expertise in a data platform context but not core AI/ML model building or GenAI specialization."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to technical demonstrations, client interaction, and integration within a data platform. However, it lacks specific details about AI/ML tasks or technologies, making it difficult to definitively classify it as AI-adjacent without assuming the 'Data Intelligence Platform' heavily relies on AI/ML in a way not explicitly stated. The absence of explicit AI/ML keywords leads to a slightly lower confidence score than a perfect 5."
