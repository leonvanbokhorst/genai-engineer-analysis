While it mentions 'LLM' and 'cloud platform that caters most modern LLM applications', the core responsibilities do not involve developing, fine-tuning, or engineering prompts for LLMs themselves. The role is about building the infrastructure that *supports* LLM applications, not the AI models directly. Therefore, it fits the 'Software Engineer' profile."

The mention of LLM is in the context of the platform's purpose, not the engineer's direct tasks related to AI model development. The required skills and tasks align perfectly with the 'Software Engineer' profile."
