While it mentions leveraging and fine-tuning existing models, it explicitly states 'not building new AI models from scratch.' The primary focus is on the software engineering aspects of adopting and integrating AI, rather than deep AI model development or research. The mention of 'AWS Serverless with TypeScript' as the tech stack further reinforces the software engineering foundation. Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."
