While AI tools and AI-driven systems are mentioned as the means to achieve these tasks, the core responsibilities do not involve developing or fine-tuning AI models themselves (Category B). Instead, the role is about integrating and utilizing AI as a tool to enhance existing operational processes and software functions. The mention of 'scripting' and 'system configuration' further reinforces the software engineering foundation. Therefore, it fits the profile of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, where AI is a component of the software engineering work, rather than the primary focus of AI model development."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the tasks and responsibilities, emphasizing traditional engineering and operational aspects augmented by AI tools. It explicitly states it's not a traditional engineering or support role but combines technical work with AI tools. The distinction between using AI tools and developing AI models is clear. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the specific AI tools or models are not detailed, and the term 'AI-driven systems' is broad."
