However, it does not explicitly mention specific software development tasks like coding or building backend services, which would have made the classification even more definitive for 'Software Engineer' or 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer'. The absence of explicit coding tasks makes it lean towards 'AI-Adjacent' rather than a pure 'Software Engineer' role, but the core tasks are still within Macro-Category A."
