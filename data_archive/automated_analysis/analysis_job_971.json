    "profile": {
        "assigned_profile": "GenAI Specialist",
        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on tasks related to training and evaluating generative AI models, specifically by creating and answering computer science questions and assessing AI-generated code. These tasks fall predominantly under Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization), with no mention of core software engineering tasks like building applications, MLOps, or integration. While it mentions 'experienced software engineer', the core responsibilities are AI-centric and do not involve building software products that *use* AI, but rather directly *training* the AI itself. Therefore, 'GenAI Specialist' is the most fitting profile."
    },
    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines tasks related to training and evaluating generative AI models. However, it is quite brief and lacks detail on the specific technologies or the broader context of the projects. The mention of 'software engineer' could be interpreted in multiple ways, but the core tasks strongly point towards AI specialization. The absence of explicit software engineering tasks (Macro-Category A) makes the profile assignment clear, but the lack of detail on the AI tasks themselves prevents a perfect score."
