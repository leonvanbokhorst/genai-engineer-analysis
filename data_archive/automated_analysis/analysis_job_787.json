While there's a strong focus on model development (1.B.1), the tasks also involve integrating these models and workflows into tools and roadmaps (1.A.1), indicating a balance between specialized AI work and software engineering practices. The mention of 'generative AI models' and the focus on adapting architectures for specific paradigms points towards GenAI specialization rather than traditional ML. The role requires a deep understanding of AI model development and implementation, fitting the 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile."
