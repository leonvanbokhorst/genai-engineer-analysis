The core tasks involve software development, integration, and CI/CD pipeline management. There are no specific tasks or technologies mentioned that relate to core AI/ML model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, RAG, or traditional ML specializations. The mention of 'AI-driven solutions' appears to be in the context of enhancing existing software functionalities rather than building AI models themselves. Therefore, the role is classified as a 'Software Engineer'."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is reasonably clear about the tasks, which are primarily software engineering focused. However, the mention of 'AI-driven solutions' is somewhat vague and could be interpreted in different ways, preventing a perfect score. The absence of specific AI/ML technologies or deep AI tasks makes the classification towards 'Software Engineer' strong, but the ambiguity in the AI mention slightly reduces confidence."
