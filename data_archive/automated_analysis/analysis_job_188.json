While it mentions collaboration with LLM engineers and contributing to an AI assistant's development (which touches on integration), the core focus remains on the data infrastructure supporting these AI applications. There are no tasks related to model development or fine-tuning (1.B.1) or prompt engineering (1.B.2). The role is primarily about enabling AI applications through robust data engineering, rather than building the AI models themselves or the core application logic that uses them. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile, where the primary focus is on the engineering aspects that support AI, rather than the AI specialization itself."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines data engineering responsibilities and mentions AI applications (LLMs, AI assistant). The distinction between data engineering and core AI development is clear. However, the ad could be more specific about the exact nature of the 'AI assistant's development' to fully confirm it's not a deeper AI role. The emphasis on data pipelines and architecture strongly points to the AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."
