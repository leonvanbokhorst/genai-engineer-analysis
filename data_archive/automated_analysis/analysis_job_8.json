        "rationale": "The job description heavily emphasizes traditional software engineering tasks such as designing and developing canvas components, improving microservices APIs, and contributing to technical strategy. The AI component is specifically focused on integrating generative AI capabilities into these core user flows and components. There is no mention of developing, fine-tuning, or researching the AI models themselves, nor specific tasks related to prompt engineering or RAG. This aligns with the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile, which builds software that uses AI as a core component rather than developing the AI models themselves."
