        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on traditional software engineering tasks such as tackling complex greenfield projects, transforming environments, and working with microservices and event sourcing. While 'generative AI' is mentioned, it's in the context of receiving training alongside other technical skills, not as a primary job responsibility. The role emphasizes building and integrating these technologies into software, aligning with the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile, which is predominantly 'Macro-Category A' with AI as a component."
    },
    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is clear about the core software engineering nature of the role and the technologies involved. The mention of generative AI is framed as a training area rather than a core task, making the classification straightforward. However, it's not a 5 because the ad is more of a general recruitment pitch than a detailed task breakdown, leaving slight room for interpretation on the depth of AI involvement."
