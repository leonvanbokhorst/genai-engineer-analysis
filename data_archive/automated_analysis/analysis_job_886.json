While there's an element of AI improvement (1.B.1), the core responsibility is the integration and application of AI within a broader support function, aligning more with 'Software Development & Integration' (1.A.1). The role is not focused on building AI models from scratch or deep AI research, but rather on using and enhancing AI tools to improve a product/service. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to AI integration and improvement, but it's not a deep AI engineering role. The tasks are more about applying and refining AI within a support context. The profile assignment is reasonably confident, but the distinction between 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' and a 'GenAI Specialist' could be slightly clearer with more explicit details on the depth of AI model work."
