While it mentions using AI to accelerate delivery, the core responsibilities and technologies (Tableau, Alteryx) are not AI/ML specific. There are no tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. Therefore, it aligns best with the 'Software Engineer' profile, as it involves building and integrating solutions, with AI being an enabling tool rather than the core focus of the role."

The primary focus remains on BI development and client interaction. The confidence is high, but not perfect, as the exact nature of 'using AI' is vague."
