While 'GenAI' is mentioned as a focus area for one team, the core responsibilities and technologies described are predominantly software engineering. There are no specific tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG, nor are there mentions of specific GenAI frameworks or models. The role is about integrating or working within an environment that has GenAI, rather than specializing in GenAI model development itself."

The mention of 'GenAI' is present but lacks detail regarding specific tasks or technologies related to generative AI model development, making the classification of 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' highly probable but not definitively 'Core GenAI Engineer'."
