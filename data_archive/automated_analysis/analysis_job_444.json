While it mentions AI-generated summaries (a GenAI task), the overall focus is on integrating AI into existing software development workflows and products, rather than specializing in the development or fine-tuning of GenAI models themselves. The role is primarily about building software that uses AI as a co-pilot or booster, fitting the description of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

The language is enthusiastic and descriptive, but it doesn't delve into the specifics of model development or deep GenAI architecture, making it slightly less precise than a role explicitly focused on GenAI Specialist or Core GenAI Engineer. However, the distinction between AI-Adjacent Software Engineer and Software Engineer is clear, as AI integration is a core responsibility."
