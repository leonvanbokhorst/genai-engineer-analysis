                "justification": "This phrase describes the core activity of building and deploying AI systems as part of a larger software solution, focusing on the engineering and integration aspects rather than the model development itself. The emphasis is on creating 'scalable solutions' and 'revolutionizing business operations', which aligns with the integration of AI into broader software products."

        "assigned_profile": "AI-Adjacent Software Engineer",
        "rationale": "The job ad focuses on designing and implementing AI systems as part of broader business operations and scalable solutions. The core task described falls under 'Software Development & Integration' (1.A.1), with no specific mention of AI model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or traditional ML tasks. This indicates the role is about integrating AI capabilities into software rather than specializing in AI model creation, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is concise but clearly states the primary focus is on designing and implementing AI systems within a business context, emphasizing scalability and autonomous operation. While it lacks specific technical details or mentions of AI/ML tools, the core responsibility described aligns well with the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile. The confidence is high due to the clarity of the main task, but not perfect due to the lack of further detail."
