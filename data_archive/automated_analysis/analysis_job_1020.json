        "assigned_profile": "Core GenAI Engineer",
        "rationale": "The job ad mentions supporting the development of 'assets (e.g., plugins)' which falls under Software Development & Integration (Macro-Category A). It also explicitly mentions 'AI R&D initiatives' which points to Model Development & Fine-Tuning (Macro-Category B). The mention of 'AI strategy' and 'driving initiatives' suggests a balanced involvement in both software engineering aspects and AI specialization, leaning towards GenAI given the current market focus on AI strategy. Without specific GenAI tools or tasks mentioned, it's a general AI role, but the balance of A and B tasks points to a Core Engineer profile. Assuming 'AI strategy' implies modern AI, it leans towards GenAI."
    },
    "confidence": {
        "score": 3,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is very brief and lacks specific details about the types of AI or the technologies involved. While it clearly indicates a mix of software development and AI R&D, the exact nature of the 'AI strategy' and 'initiatives' is not specified, making it difficult to definitively classify as GenAI vs. traditional ML. The confidence is moderate due to the brevity and lack of specific technical or AI-related keywords."
