The primary focus is on applying software engineering skills to the task of AI model training and improvement, rather than deep model development or GenAI specialization. The tasks described, like 'helping cutting-edge generative AI models write better code', indicate the integration of AI training into a broader software engineering context, making 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' the most fitting profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite brief and focuses heavily on the payment structure and contract details rather than specific technical responsibilities or required tools. While it mentions 'software engineer' and 'train AI models', the lack of detail on the specific tasks, technologies, or the nature of the 'human feedback' makes it difficult to assign a more precise profile or categorize tasks with high confidence. The core task of 'training AI models' is mentioned, but the depth and nature of this training are not elaborated upon."
