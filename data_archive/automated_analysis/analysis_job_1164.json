While it mentions working with LLMs like GPT-4 and Claude to create AI features, the core responsibility is integrating these into broader web applications. The role explicitly states it's not for narrow AI development or specialization in AI models themselves, but rather for building AI-powered applications. This aligns with the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile, where the majority of tasks fall under Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration), with a significant component of AI specialization (Macro-Category B) integrated into the software product."
