While it mentions 'generative AI capabilities', the primary focus and described responsibilities are on the software engineering aspects of developing and integrating these capabilities into a digital assistant. There are no explicit tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. Therefore, the role is classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, where AI/ML features are integrated into a product, but the core of the role is software engineering."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is very clear about the responsibilities and technologies involved. It explicitly states 'Full Stack Developer' and details the front-end and back-end development tasks. The mention of generative AI is in the context of integration, not core AI development, making the classification straightforward."
