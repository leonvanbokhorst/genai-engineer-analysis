        "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on data engineering tasks (Macro-Category B, specifically 1.B.3) such as designing data architectures, building data streams, and managing data for LLM applications and vector databases. It also includes some software development and integration tasks (Macro-Category A, 1.A.1) like implementing access control and operational tasks (1.A.2) like monitoring and optimization. However, the core responsibility is data management and pipeline creation to support AI applications, rather than developing the AI models themselves or integrating AI features into a broader software product. The role is described as supporting LLM engineers and enabling AI applications, fitting the profile of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer who builds the data infrastructure that AI models rely on."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the responsibilities related to data architecture, data streams, and supporting LLM engineers. The mention of specific technologies like 'vector database' and 'AWS' further clarifies the domain. The primary focus on data engineering for AI applications makes the profile assignment straightforward. A slightly lower score is given because the role doesn't explicitly detail building or integrating AI features into a user-facing product, which is a hallmark of the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile, but the strong emphasis on data for AI applications strongly points towards this classification."
