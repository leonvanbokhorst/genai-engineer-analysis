        "rationale": "The job advertisement focuses entirely on Quality Engineering and Testing tasks, which fall under Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration). While it mentions the use of Generative AI tools like ChatGPT and concepts like Prompt Engineering to enhance testing processes, these are presented as assistive tools for productivity rather than core AI development or integration into the end product. The role's primary output is quality-assured software, not an AI-powered system. This aligns with the Software Engineer profile, which involves exclusively Macro-Category A tasks and may mention AI-assisted tools for productivity."

The distinction between core software engineering tasks and the application of AI as an assistive tool is well-defined, leading to a high degree of certainty in the analysis."
