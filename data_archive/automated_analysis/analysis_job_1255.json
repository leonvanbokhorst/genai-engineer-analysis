        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on traditional machine learning tasks such as processing complex data with ML, data mining, and deep learning technologies, using statistical models and predictive algorithms to reveal patterns. While it mentions developing end-to-end solutions and operationalizing work for production (1.A.1), the core emphasis is on the ML model development and application itself (1.B.1). There is no mention of Generative AI specific tasks like LLMs, RAG, or prompt engineering. Therefore, the role aligns best with a 'Core ML Engineer' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines traditional ML tasks and the development of solutions for production. However, it lacks specific technology mentions and doesn't delve into the nuances of AI/ML methodologies beyond general terms. The absence of any Generative AI specific terms makes the profile assignment clear, but the lack of technical specifics limits the confidence score slightly."
