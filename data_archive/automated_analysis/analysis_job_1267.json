It mentions transforming the sector, reducing administrative burdens, predicting diseases, and improving efficiency, but it does not specify any core software engineering tasks (Macro-Category A) or AI specialization tasks (Macro-Category B) such as model development, prompt engineering, RAG, MLOps, or specific technology stacks. Therefore, it does not provide enough information to classify the role into any of the defined AI/ML profiles."

It only describes the company's general mission and the broad impact of AI in healthcare. This makes it impossible to accurately classify the job tasks, technologies, or assign a relevant profile based on the provided Coding Book."
