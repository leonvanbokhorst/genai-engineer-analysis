While there are tasks related to evaluating and optimizing LLM output and models (2 tasks in Macro-Category B), the core focus remains on the engineering and integration of LLM-driven solutions into cloud environments. This aligns with the definition of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, where the role is primarily software engineering with AI/ML as a key component of the product."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is clear about the core responsibilities and the focus on LLMs, using specific verbs for software engineering tasks. However, it lacks specific technology mentions (e.g., specific LLMs, frameworks, cloud providers), which would have made the classification even more precise. The task distribution clearly leans towards software engineering with AI integration."
