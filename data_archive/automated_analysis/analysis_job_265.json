        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on core software engineering tasks such as developing backend services, cloud infrastructure, and REST APIs, and optimizing CI/CD pipelines. While it mentions integrating AI models into customer workflows and working with ML engineers, the primary emphasis is on the software engineering aspects of building and maintaining the platform. There are no specific tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG, which are characteristic of Core GenAI or ML Engineer roles. Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, as it involves building software that utilizes AI but does not focus on the AI model development itself."
