        "rationale": "The job description heavily emphasizes traditional software engineering tasks such as implementing end-to-end ML pipelines and leading AI projects (Macro-Category A). While it involves advising clients on ML strategies and participating in pre-sales (Business Understanding & Strategy), there is no explicit mention of core ML model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). The focus is on integrating and managing ML solutions within client projects, rather than the deep specialization in AI model creation itself. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the responsibilities, particularly the emphasis on implementing ML pipelines and client-facing advisory roles. However, it lacks specific details on the types of ML models or generative AI techniques involved, which prevents a perfect score. The distinction between traditional ML and GenAI is not explicitly made, but the tasks lean towards the engineering and integration side."
