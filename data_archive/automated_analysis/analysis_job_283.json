        "rationale": "The job ad describes a balanced mix of core software engineering tasks (data pipelines, Linux server management) and AI specialization tasks. Specifically, it mentions 'Generative AI', 'GenAI Suite', and 'Klus Coach' (a generative AI assistant), indicating a focus on GenAI. The role also involves managing Dataiku projects and supporting data science initiatives, which are AI-related but lean towards traditional ML/data engineering. The explicit mention of generative AI projects and the blend of infrastructure/pipeline work with AI development strongly suggest the 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to both data engineering/infrastructure and generative AI projects. While the specific technologies for GenAI are not deeply detailed, the mention of 'GenAI Suite' and 'Klus Coach' (generative AI assistant) is strong evidence. The inclusion of data pipelines and Linux server management anchors it in software engineering. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, due to the lack of explicit mention of LLM frameworks or specific models, and the 'GenAI Suite' and 'Klus Coach' are treated as frameworks/libraries for classification as their exact nature isn't specified beyond being GenAI projects."
