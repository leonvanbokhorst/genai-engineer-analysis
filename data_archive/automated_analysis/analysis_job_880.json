The core responsibilities are within software development and integration (Macro-Category A), specifically in quality assurance automation. There are no tasks related to developing, fine-tuning, or specializing in AI/ML models themselves (Macro-Category B). Therefore, it aligns best with the 'Software Engineer' profile, as it uses AI as a tool within a software engineering context rather than building AI systems."

However, it doesn't go into extreme detail about the specific AI technologies or the depth of AI model interaction, which prevents a perfect score. The classification as a Software Engineer is strongly supported by the text."
