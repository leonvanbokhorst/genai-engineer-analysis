While it mentions the use of LLMs and specific AI technologies like GPT-4 Vision, the primary emphasis is on integrating these into existing systems and providing support for their use within workflows. There is no indication of core model development, fine-tuning, or deep specialization in generative AI techniques themselves, but rather the application of these technologies within a software engineering context. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."
