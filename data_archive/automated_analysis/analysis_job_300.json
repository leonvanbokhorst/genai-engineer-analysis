        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on tasks related to training and evaluating generative AI models ('help train AI models', 'Evaluating and ranking code generated by AI models'). While it mentions 'experienced software engineer', the core responsibilities are centered around the AI model's learning process and output, rather than integrating AI into existing software systems (Macro-Category A). There are no explicit software development or MLOps tasks mentioned. Therefore, the role is best classified as a 'GenAI Specialist'."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines tasks related to AI model training and evaluation, making the classification of the core responsibilities straightforward. However, it lacks detail on specific technologies or the broader software engineering context, which prevents a perfect score. The mention of 'experienced software engineer' could imply some integration, but the explicit tasks are all within AI specialization."
