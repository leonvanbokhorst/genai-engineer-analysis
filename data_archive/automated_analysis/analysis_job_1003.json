These tasks fall under Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization), specifically 'Model Development & Fine-Tuning' (1.B.1). There are no tasks mentioned that fall under Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering). While the role involves coding expertise, it's applied directly to the AI model's learning process rather than building software applications that integrate AI. Therefore, the profile 'ML Specialist (Data Scientist)' is the most appropriate, as the core focus is on the AI model's development and refinement."

However, it is a bit light on specific technical details or the exact nature of the 'computer science' questions, which prevents a perfect score. The role is clearly focused on the AI model's learning process, making the profile assignment straightforward."
