        "rationale": "The job advertisement is for a Senior DevOps Engineer with a focus on Microsoft 365. While it mentions 'exploring new possibilities such as adaptive cards and generative AI,' the core responsibilities are centered around software development lifecycle management, codebase scaling, quality improvements, and overseeing application lifecycles (1.A.1). The role also involves DevOps practices (1.A.2). The mention of generative AI is exploratory and not a primary focus of model development or specialization. Therefore, the role is primarily a software engineering role that integrates or explores AI, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."
    },
    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly defines the core responsibilities as DevOps and software engineering tasks. The mention of generative AI is secondary and exploratory. The profile assignment is straightforward based on this emphasis. A slightly lower score is given because the mention of 'generative AI' could be interpreted in multiple ways, but the overall context strongly points to an AI-adjacent role rather than a core AI role."
