        "rationale": "The job ad heavily emphasizes traditional software engineering tasks such as designing, developing, scaling, and integrating platforms and services ('Macro-Category A'). While it mentions leveraging AI models and algorithms to transform threat defense, the core focus remains on building the platform and services that *use* these AI capabilities, rather than the deep development or specialization of the AI models themselves ('Macro-Category B'). The role is about integrating AI into a security platform, making it an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering responsibilities and mentions the use of AI/ML. However, it doesn't go into deep detail about specific AI model development or GenAI techniques, making it lean towards an adjacent role rather than a core AI/ML role. The confidence is high due to the clear software engineering focus, but not a perfect 5 because the AI aspects are described at a higher level."
