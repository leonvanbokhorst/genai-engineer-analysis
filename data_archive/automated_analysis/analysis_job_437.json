        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the core responsibilities as enhancing software development processes with AI. While it uses evocative language ('superhero status', 'conjuring code like magic'), the underlying tasks are consistently framed within software engineering. The distinction between AI-as-a-tool for software engineering versus AI model development is reasonably clear, leading to a high confidence score."
