The responsibilities involve developing software components like a CMS and an inference engine, and integrating AI capabilities developed by others. The core of the work is software engineering, with AI being a key feature of the product being built, rather than the primary focus of model development or specialization. This aligns with the definition of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."
