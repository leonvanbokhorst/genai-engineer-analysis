It also emphasizes traditional software engineering aspects like designing and maintaining data pipelines, writing robust production code, and collaborating with teams (1.A.1). There is no mention of Generative AI specific tasks or technologies. The mentorship aspect points to a more senior role. Therefore, 'Core ML Engineer' is the most fitting profile."
