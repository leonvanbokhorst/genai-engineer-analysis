        "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on traditional software engineering and operational tasks such as scripting, system configuration, incident management, and optimizing/automating processes. While AI is mentioned as a tool to achieve these goals, the core responsibilities do not involve developing, fine-tuning, or deeply specializing in AI models themselves. The role is about applying AI tools to enhance existing operational workflows, rather than building AI capabilities. Therefore, it aligns best with a 'Software Engineer' profile that leverages AI tools."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the tasks and responsibilities, emphasizing traditional operational and system engineering aspects. The use of AI is framed as a tool for these tasks, rather than the core focus of development. The distinction between this role and a core AI/ML role is evident, leading to a high confidence in the 'Software Engineer' profile assignment. However, the specific mention of 'AI System Building' could be interpreted slightly differently, hence not a perfect 5."
