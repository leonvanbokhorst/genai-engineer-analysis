        "rationale": "The job description heavily emphasizes traditional software engineering tasks such as 'code-level improvements in our monolith', 'architectural evolution towards a scalable system', and 'championing quality across engineering'. While it mentions AI-assisted development and educating the team on AI tools, it does not indicate that the core responsibility is building or fine-tuning AI models themselves. Instead, the role is about integrating AI into the existing software development process and platform to improve efficiency and outcomes. The tasks are predominantly from Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration), with a focus on leveraging AI as a tool within that context, rather than specializing in AI model development (Macro-Category B). Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to software engineering and the integration of AI tools into the development process. It explicitly states the role is for a 'Principal Backend Engineer' and focuses on 'AI-assisted development' rather than core AI model building. The distinction between leveraging AI for development and developing AI models is clear. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the specific AI tools or models are not detailed, and the 'AI-assisted development' aspect could be interpreted in slightly different ways, though the overall emphasis remains on the backend engineering role."
