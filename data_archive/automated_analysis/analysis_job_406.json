The responsibilities are categorized under Macro-Category A (specifically 1.A.1. Software Development & Integration for architecture and 1.C.1. Business Understanding & Strategy for strategy and business alignment) and Soft Skills (3.1. Communication & Collaboration). Crucially, there are no tasks from Macro-Category B (model development, prompt engineering, data engineering). The role is about leading and strategizing ML/AI capabilities, including Generative AI, rather than hands-on implementation of models or features. Among the provided profiles, AI-Adjacent Software Engineer is the closest fit because the role is predominantly Macro-Category A and its output is directly related to enabling AI-powered systems and features by defining the necessary strategy and architecture, even if it doesn't involve direct hands-on integration. The 'AI-Adjacent' aspect accurately reflects the focus on ML/AI strategy and architecture from a broader engineering perspective."

        "reasoning": "The job advertisement is clear about the strategic and architectural responsibilities of the role. The absence of specific technologies is noted, but the core duties are well-defined. The profile assignment is based on interpreting the role's strategic focus within the given categories, making it a strong but not entirely unambiguous fit."
