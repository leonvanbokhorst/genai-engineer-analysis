While it mentions 'rule-based generative AI' in the introduction, the core responsibilities and tasks described focus on the pipeline, tooling, automation, and integration of graphics and rendering technologies. There is no explicit mention of working with LLMs, prompt engineering, RAG, or fine-tuning generative models. The role is about building the infrastructure and tools that *support* content creation, which may include AI, but the primary focus is on the engineering of the pipeline itself. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer role, where the software engineering aspect is dominant, and AI is a component or enabler rather than the core focus of the tasks."

However, the mention of 'rule-based generative AI' is brief and not elaborated upon in the tasks, making it slightly ambiguous whether the 'AI' component is central or peripheral. The core focus remains on pipeline development and graphics engineering. The confidence is high but not perfect due to this slight ambiguity regarding the depth of AI involvement."
