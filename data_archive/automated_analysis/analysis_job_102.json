While it mentions 'LLM mission-critical applications', the core responsibilities described do not involve specific AI/ML model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. The role is about building the infrastructure that *supports* these applications, not developing the AI components themselves. Therefore, it aligns best with the 'Software Engineer' profile."
