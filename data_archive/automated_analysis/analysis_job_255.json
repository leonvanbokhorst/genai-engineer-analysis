While it mentions AI-related project areas like 'robotic accounting', 'intelligent payment matching', and 'cash flow prediction', the description of the role itself does not involve the development, fine-tuning, or specific integration of AI/ML models. The tasks are classified under 'Software Development & Integration' (1.A.1), and there are no tasks that fall under the 'GenAI Specialization' macro-category (1.B). Therefore, the profile is 'Software Engineer'."

The technologies listed are also standard software development tools. The mention of AI-related project areas is contextual to the business domain rather than the core engineering tasks of the role."
