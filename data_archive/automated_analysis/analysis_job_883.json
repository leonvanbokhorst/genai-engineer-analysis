While it mentions 'AI-powered solutions' and 'AI-driven automation,' these are presented as enhancements to existing business processes and applications rather than the core focus of developing or fine-tuning AI models themselves. The role is about integrating AI capabilities into a software product (Salesforce CPQ), aligning with the definition of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, which predominantly involves tasks from Macro-Category A with AI integration."

However, it lacks specific details about the AI technologies or models to be used, making it impossible to classify the AI aspect more granularly. The focus remains on the Salesforce platform and its applications."
