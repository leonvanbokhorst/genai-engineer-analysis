These tasks fall predominantly under Macro-Category B ('GenAI Specialization'). While there is mention of partnering with other teams (1.C.1, 3.1), there are no explicit tasks related to traditional software engineering (Macro-Category A) such as building production-grade applications, microservices, or managing CI/CD pipelines for software deployment. The role is centered on the AI models themselves, not on integrating them into a broader software product. Therefore, 'GenAI Specialist' is the most appropriate profile."
