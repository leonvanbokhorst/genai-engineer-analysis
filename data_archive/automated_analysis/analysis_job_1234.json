        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on working within a team of data scientists and software/ML professionals to optimize and innovate customer service, processes, and quality using AI solutions. It also emphasizes collaboration within an engineering guild for knowledge exchange and career acceleration. While AI is mentioned, the core tasks described lean towards integrating and optimizing existing AI solutions within a broader software engineering context, rather than deep model development or specialized GenAI tasks. There are no specific GenAI or traditional ML tasks or technologies mentioned, but the framing suggests the application of AI within a software engineering framework."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 2,
        "reasoning": "The job advertisement is very brief and lacks specific details about the actual tasks involved in the Machine Learning Engineer role, particularly concerning GenAI or traditional ML. It focuses more on the team structure and collaborative environment. This makes it difficult to definitively categorize the core responsibilities and assign a precise profile beyond a general AI-adjacent software engineering role."
