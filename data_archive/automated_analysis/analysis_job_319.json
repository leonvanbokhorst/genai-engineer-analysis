    "profile": {
        "assigned_profile": "GenAI Specialist",
        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on tasks related to training and evaluating generative AI models, specifically by creating and answering computer science questions and assessing AI-generated code. While it mentions software engineering expertise, the core responsibilities are centered around the AI model's learning process rather than integrating AI into a larger software product. There are no explicit software development or MLOps tasks mentioned. Therefore, the profile leans towards a specialist role focused on the AI model itself."
    },
    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite specific about the tasks involved in training and evaluating AI models, which clearly points towards AI Specialization. However, it's a freelance, remote position with flexible hours, and the description is relatively brief. While the core tasks are clear, the lack of detail on the specific AI models or the broader context of the projects prevents a perfect score. The mention of 'software-engineer' in the intro could be slightly misleading if interpreted as a traditional software engineering role, but the subsequent tasks clarify the AI-centric nature."
