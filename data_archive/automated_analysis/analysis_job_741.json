        "rationale": "The job advertisement focuses heavily on core software engineering tasks related to Azure cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, scripting, and general system management (Macro-Category A). While it mentions exploring GenAI, LLM, and Copilots, these are listed as areas for learning and exploration rather than core responsibilities. There are no specific tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, as it involves building and managing the infrastructure that might support AI, but not the AI development itself."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines a strong focus on Azure infrastructure, DevOps, and scripting, which are core software engineering tasks. The mention of GenAI/LLM is in the context of learning and exploration, not direct implementation. This makes the classification as 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' quite clear. However, a perfect score is not given because the extent to which GenAI/LLM will be integrated into the role in the future is not fully detailed, leaving a slight ambiguity about potential future shifts."
