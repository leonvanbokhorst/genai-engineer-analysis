These tasks fall under Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization), particularly 'Model Development & Fine-Tuning' (1.B.1). There are no tasks mentioned that fall under Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering) such as software development, integration, or MLOps. Therefore, the role is predominantly focused on the AI specialization aspect, fitting the 'ML Specialist (Data Scientist)' profile, with a specific emphasis on generative AI."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the core tasks involved in training and evaluating AI models. While it mentions 'software engineer' in the introduction, the detailed responsibilities are entirely focused on AI model interaction and data creation for training. The lack of explicit software engineering tasks (like building pipelines, integration, or deployment) makes the classification towards a specialist role clear. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the initial mention of 'software engineer' could be slightly ambiguous without the subsequent detailed task descriptions."
