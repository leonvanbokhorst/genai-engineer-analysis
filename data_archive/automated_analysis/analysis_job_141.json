There are no mentions of AI/ML tasks, models, or related technologies. The tasks described fall squarely under 'Macro-Category A: Core Software Engineering', specifically '1.A.1. Software Development & Integration' and '1.A.2. Operations & MLOps (LLMOps)' (though the latter is not explicitly coded due to lack of AI/ML specifics). The role does not involve building or integrating AI/ML features into products, nor does it focus on AI specialization. Therefore, the 'Software Engineer' profile is the most appropriate fit."
