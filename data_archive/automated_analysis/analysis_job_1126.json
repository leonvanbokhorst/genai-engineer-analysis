While there's mention of 'AI model fine-tuning sessions' (Macro-Category B), the core responsibility is the application and improvement of AI within a support context, rather than deep model development or specialization. The role is about using and enhancing AI as part of a broader support system, aligning with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

The tasks lean heavily towards applying and refining existing AI systems rather than building them from scratch or specializing in advanced AI research. The profile assignment is well-supported by the text, though the mention of 'fine-tuning' could slightly blur lines if it were a more significant part of the role."
