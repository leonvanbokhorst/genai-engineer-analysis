There are no tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or specific ML data engineering. The mention of 'Generative AI' in the context of supporting creators indicates the application domain of the ML models being integrated, rather than the core tasks of the role. Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer because it builds software that uses AI/ML features, but the primary responsibilities are software engineering."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering responsibilities. While the title 'Machine Learning Engineer' and the mention of 'Generative AI' provide context, the core tasks described are purely within the software development and integration domain, aligning well with the AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile. The confidence is high due to the clarity of the described tasks, though not a perfect 5 as the title might suggest more ML-specific duties than are explicitly listed."
