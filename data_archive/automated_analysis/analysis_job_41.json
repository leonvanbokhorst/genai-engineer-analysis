According to the `CODING_BOOK.md`, the `Not Relevant` profile is assigned when \"The job ad shows no significant tasks from A or B.\" As no tasks are described, this profile is the most appropriate classification."

There is no descriptive content from which to extract job tasks, technologies (beyond \"Go\"), or soft skills. This lack of information makes it impossible to perform a meaningful analysis or confidently assign any of the defined profiles, as the core criteria (job tasks) are entirely absent."
