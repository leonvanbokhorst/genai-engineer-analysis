        "rationale": "The job advertisement focuses heavily on traditional software engineering tasks such as developing solutions, working within agile teams, and translating business demands into technical specifications. While it mentions fields like natural language processing and image recognition, it does not specify any tasks related to building, fine-tuning, or deploying generative AI models or specific GenAI frameworks. The role is described as a 'Data Engineer/developer' and emphasizes data architecture and analysis within a broader software development context, fitting the 'Software Engineer' profile which is predominantly Macro-Category A with no significant Macro-Category B tasks related to GenAI."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the core responsibilities being software development and data engineering. However, it mentions AI/ML fields (NLP, time series, image recognition) without detailing specific GenAI tasks, which could lead to ambiguity if the role were intended to be more AI-focused. The absence of any mention of LLMs, RAG, or specific GenAI tools makes it lean towards a traditional data engineering/software engineering role."
