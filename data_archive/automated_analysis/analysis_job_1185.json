        "rationale": "The job advertisement focuses heavily on traditional software engineering tasks such as 'Spark programming', 'integrating with the wider cloud ecosystem and 3rd party applications', and 'authoring reference architectures, how-tos, and demo applications'. While it mentions 'Big Data Analytics', there is no explicit mention of AI/ML models, Generative AI, LLMs, or related specialized tasks. The role is about leveraging a data platform to solve customer data challenges and build solutions, which aligns with integrating technical capabilities into a product or service, but not with developing or specializing in AI/ML models themselves. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile as it involves technical expertise in a data platform context, but not AI/ML model development or specialization."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to technical demonstrations, integration, and customer-facing advisory roles. However, it lacks specific details about AI/ML technologies or tasks, making it difficult to definitively classify it within AI-specific roles. The mention of 'Databricks Data Intelligence Platform' and 'Big Data Analytics' suggests a data-centric role, but not necessarily AI/ML model development. The confidence is high for the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile due to the strong emphasis on software integration and customer solutions, but not a perfect 5 because the absence of explicit AI/ML tasks prevents a more precise classification within the AI spectrum."
