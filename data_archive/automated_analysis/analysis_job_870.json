While it mentions experimenting with AI tools like GPT-4 Vision and Amazon CodeWhisperer, the core focus remains on integrating these into existing processes and infrastructures to create scalable, automated systems. There is no mention of core ML model development, fine-tuning, or deep dives into generative AI specific tasks like prompt engineering or RAG. The role is about building software that leverages AI, rather than specializing in the AI models themselves."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering responsibilities with an AI component. The tasks are predominantly in Macro-Category A, with only a minor mention of exploring AI tools (1.B.1). This makes the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile a strong fit. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as 'AI automations' could be interpreted slightly more broadly, though the context strongly points to software integration."
