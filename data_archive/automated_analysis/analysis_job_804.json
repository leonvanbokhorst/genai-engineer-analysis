While it mentions developing 'end-to-end solutions' and 'robust solutions that are used in production' (1.A.1, 1.A.2), indicating software engineering and MLOps aspects, the core emphasis is on the ML model development itself. There is no mention of Generative AI specific tasks like LLMs, RAG, or prompt engineering. The role also involves client interaction and understanding business needs (1.C.1), but the technical focus remains on traditional ML."

However, it doesn't explicitly mention specific technologies or delve deeply into the nuances of either ML or GenAI, which prevents a perfect score. The distinction between ML and GenAI is clear from the absence of GenAI terms."
