While it mentions leveraging generative AI and creating educational content using it (1.B.3), the core responsibilities and the overall framing of the role are about building and enhancing software products that *use* AI, rather than specializing in the AI model development or GenAI specific tasks themselves. The technologies listed are primarily front-end and cloud infrastructure. Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

However, it doesn't go into deep detail about the specific AI tasks or models, making it slightly less definitive than a role solely focused on AI research or model building. The profile assignment is strong based on the emphasis on software development."
