        "rationale": "The job ad heavily emphasizes traditional software development tasks (1.A.1) such as integrating AI features into existing products, building widgets, APIs, CRM solutions, and developing back-end services. While it mentions specific AI technologies like RAG and GPT-4 (1.B.2) and data analytics modules (1.B.3), these are presented as components to be integrated into broader software products. The core focus remains on building and enhancing software applications, with AI serving as a key feature or tool to achieve this. There is no indication of deep model development or specialized AI research. Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."
