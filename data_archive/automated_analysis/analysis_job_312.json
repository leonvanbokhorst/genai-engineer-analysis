        "assigned_profile": "GenAI Specialist",
        "rationale": "The job advertisement focuses heavily on tasks related to training and evaluating generative AI models, specifically through interaction and feedback on code generation. While it mentions software engineering expertise, the core responsibilities (1.B.1) are centered around the AI model's learning process rather than building software applications that integrate AI. There are no explicit tasks related to software development & integration (Macro-Category A) or MLOps. Therefore, the role is best classified as a GenAI Specialist."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines tasks related to AI model training and evaluation, specifically for generative AI. The language is direct about the nature of the work. However, it's a freelance, remote position with flexible hours, which might imply less structured collaboration or integration tasks than a full-time, in-office role. The absence of explicit software engineering tasks (Macro-Category A) makes the 'Specialist' profile clear, but the lack of detail on the *how* of the interaction prevents a perfect score."
