        "rationale": "The job advertisement focuses exclusively on software testing, quality assurance, and process improvement. All identified tasks fall under Macro-Category A: Core Software Engineering as they relate to the development lifecycle and ensuring software quality. Crucially, there is no mention of AI, ML, or Generative AI technologies or tasks. The Software Engineer profile is defined as having exclusively Macro-Category A tasks and not involving AI/ML integration. Therefore, this role aligns with the Software Engineer profile, as it represents a traditional software engineering discipline."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is very clear and detailed regarding its responsibilities, which are all related to software testing and quality assurance. The mapping of these tasks to Macro-Category A: Core Software Engineering is reasonable, interpreting the category broadly to include testing as a fundamental software engineering activity. The soft skills are also clearly identifiable. The main challenge is fitting a pure testing role into a coding book specifically designed for GenAI Engineers. While Software Engineer is the closest profile, the book's primary focus is on AI/ML, making the fit imperfect."
