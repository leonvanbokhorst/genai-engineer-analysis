        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on designing, refining, and integrating AI tools into existing service frameworks (Macro-Category A tasks like 1.A.1). While it mentions AI technologies and methodologies, it does not detail core AI model development, fine-tuning, or specific GenAI techniques like prompt engineering or RAG (Macro-Category B tasks). The emphasis is on using AI to enhance customer service operations and reporting on its integration, aligning with the profile of a Software Engineer who builds or maintains software that directly uses AI features as a core part of its functionality."

The tasks fall primarily under software development and integration (1.A.1). However, it lacks specific details about the AI technologies or models being used, making it impossible to classify it as a Core GenAI or Core ML role. The absence of explicit AI/ML model development tasks steers it away from specialist roles. The confidence is high for the AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile due to the clear focus on integration and enhancement of AI within existing systems."
