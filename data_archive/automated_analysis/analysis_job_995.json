        "assigned_profile": "GenAI Specialist",
        "rationale": "The job ad focuses almost exclusively on tasks related to training and evaluating generative AI models (Macro-Category B, specifically 1.B.1). While it mentions 'software engineer' in the introduction, the core responsibilities described are centered around interacting with and improving AI models, not building software applications that integrate AI. There are no tasks related to software development, integration, or MLOps (Macro-Category A). Therefore, the 'GenAI Specialist' profile is the most appropriate fit."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the tasks related to AI model training and evaluation. However, it is light on specific technical details or technologies, and the 'software engineer' framing in the introduction could be slightly misleading if interpreted as a primary software development role. The focus is clearly on the AI aspect, making the 'GenAI Specialist' profile a strong fit, but the lack of explicit software engineering tasks prevents a perfect score."
