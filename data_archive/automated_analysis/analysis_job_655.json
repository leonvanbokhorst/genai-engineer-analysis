While it mentions using AI to accelerate delivery, the core tasks are traditional software engineering and data handling. There are no specific tasks or technologies related to core ML or GenAI model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. The role is primarily about building and integrating BI solutions, making it a 'Software Engineer' profile with an AI-adjacent aspect rather than a core AI role."

The mention of AI is secondary and focused on acceleration rather than core AI development. The tools mentioned (Tableau, Alteryx) are clearly traditional data tools. The confidence is high, but not perfect, as the exact nature of 'using AI' is not deeply detailed."
