While 'GenAI' is mentioned as a focus area for the Channels team, the core responsibilities and explicit tasks described are centered around software engineering leadership, feature implementation, and product maintainability. There are no explicit tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG systems. The role integrates AI as a feature within the product rather than specializing in AI model creation or deep AI research. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines core software engineering responsibilities and leadership duties. The mention of 'GenAI' as a focus area is present but not detailed with specific tasks, making the AI aspect secondary to the primary software engineering function. The confidence is high, but not perfect, due to the slight ambiguity on the depth of AI involvement."
