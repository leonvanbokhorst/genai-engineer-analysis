While there's mention of working with data scientists on ML models and exploring AI possibilities (Macro-Category B tasks), the core responsibility is building and integrating these into the Mendix platform. The role is primarily a software engineering role that leverages AI, rather than a deep AI research or model development role. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

The distinction between integrating AI into applications and deep AI model development is well-defined by the tasks listed."
