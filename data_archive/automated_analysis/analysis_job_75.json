The core tasks described involve integrating AI into the company's operations and collaborating with IT colleagues to provide solutions and improvements. There is no mention of specific AI model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. The emphasis is on the application and integration of AI, supported by a full-stack development background, aligning with the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly indicates a software engineering role focused on integrating AI, but it lacks specific details about the AI technologies or tasks involved beyond the general introduction of Generative AI. The mention of 'full-stack' suggests a software engineering foundation. The confidence is high for the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile due to the emphasis on integration and the absence of deep AI specialization tasks, but not a perfect 5 due to the limited detail on the AI aspects themselves."
