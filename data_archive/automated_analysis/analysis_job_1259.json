        "rationale": "The job ad describes building products and models using predictive modeling, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and LLMs. It explicitly mentions LLMs and chatbots as examples of products. The role involves taking insights from data analysis to build products and implementing them ('live zetten'). There's also a strong emphasis on collaboration with various business and technical teams, and with clients (co-creation). While it mentions traditional ML techniques, the inclusion of LLMs and chatbots, along with the general description of building AI-driven products, leans towards a GenAI focus. The tasks are a mix of model development (B) and product building/implementation (A), fitting the 'balanced mix' criteria for a Core GenAI Engineer."

However, it doesn't go into deep technical detail about specific MLOps or advanced software engineering practices, which prevents a perfect score. The distinction between traditional ML and GenAI is present but could be more pronounced."
