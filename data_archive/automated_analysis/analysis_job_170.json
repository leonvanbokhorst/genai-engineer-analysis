These fall under Macro-Category A (Software Engineering), specifically 1.A.1. Software Development & Integration and 1.A.2. Operations & MLOps (LLMOps). There are no tasks described that fall under Macro-Category B (AI Specialization), such as model development, fine-tuning, or prompt engineering. The role integrates AI/ML infrastructure into the organization's operations, making it an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer role."

        "reasoning": "The job advertisement is very clear and detailed regarding the responsibilities and technologies. The tasks described align well with specific categories in the coding book, and the distinction between software engineering and AI specialization is evident. The language, while Dutch, clearly outlines technical responsibilities."
