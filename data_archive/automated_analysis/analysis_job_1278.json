        "rationale": "The job ad emphasizes 'Lead Software Engineer' and focuses heavily on 'delivery of high-quality software products and features' and 'development and integration of GenAI components'. While GenAI technology is mentioned, the core responsibilities are rooted in software engineering practices (1.A.1). There are no explicit tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). The role is about integrating GenAI into software, rather than specializing in the GenAI models themselves. The soft skills also lean towards adaptability and problem-solving within a software delivery context. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

The responsibilities are well-defined and clearly fall under software engineering tasks, with no deep specialization in AI model development. This clarity allows for a high-confidence assignment of the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."
