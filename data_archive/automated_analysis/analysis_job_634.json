While it mentions 'GenAI solutions', it does not detail specific GenAI model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG implementation. The role is described as a 'Full Stack Engineer' focused on building the components of these solutions and integrating them, aligning with the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile where the primary focus is on software engineering with AI/ML as a feature."

However, it lacks specific details on the AI/ML tasks themselves, making it impossible to classify it as a 'Core GenAI Engineer' or 'GenAI Specialist'. The emphasis is strongly on the engineering aspect."
