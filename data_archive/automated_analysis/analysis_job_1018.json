While there is an explicit mention of working with machine learning models and conducting experiments (1.B.1), the core responsibilities and the job title ('Back-end Developer') emphasize the software engineering aspect. The AI component is presented as an area of interest and opportunity for growth, rather than the primary focus of the role. Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, where AI is integrated into the software product."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly states the role is 'Back-end Developer' and lists several core software development tasks. It also mentions an interest in AI and the opportunity to work with ML models, but the emphasis remains on the software engineering aspects of integrating and improving the system. The distinction between AI-Adjacent and Core GenAI is clear based on the task distribution. The confidence is high, but not perfect, as the AI component, while not dominant, is present and could be interpreted with slightly more weight by some."
