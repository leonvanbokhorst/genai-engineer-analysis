        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on traditional software engineering tasks such as system configuration, maintenance, incident management, and implementing/managing systems. While AI tools are mentioned as a means to achieve these goals, the core responsibilities do not involve developing or fine-tuning AI models themselves, nor are there specific mentions of GenAI tasks like prompt engineering or RAG. The role is about using AI to enhance existing operational processes, fitting the description of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the tasks and responsibilities, emphasizing traditional system operations and configuration enhanced by AI tools. There is a clear distinction between what the role *is* (AI-driven system implementation and management) and what it *is not* (traditional engineering or basic support). The absence of specific AI model development tasks or GenAI-specific terminology makes the classification straightforward. A slightly lower score is given because 'AI-driven systems' is a broad term, but the context strongly points to AI as a tool for operational enhancement rather than the core product."
