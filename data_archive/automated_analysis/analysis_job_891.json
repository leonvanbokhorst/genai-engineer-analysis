While it mentions exploring 'GenAI, LLM and Copilots', these are listed as areas for learning and exploration rather than core responsibilities. The role is about leading and managing Azure infrastructure and DevOps, with AI/GenAI being a secondary area of interest for learning. Therefore, the role is classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, as it's a software engineering role that may integrate AI/ML features but doesn't have AI/ML as its primary focus."

The mention of GenAI/LLM is framed as an area for learning and exploration, not a primary task. This makes the classification of 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' quite clear, but not a perfect 5 due to the potential for future integration of GenAI which isn't detailed."
