While it mentions an interest in exploring GenAI, LLM, and Copilots, these are listed as areas for learning and exploration rather than core responsibilities. The role's main output is cloud-based solutions and infrastructure, with AI/ML integration not being the central theme. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile, where AI/ML is a secondary consideration or an area for future development within a broader software engineering context."

The mention of GenAI, LLM, and Copilots is present but framed as an area for learning and exploration rather than a core, immediate responsibility. This distinction helps in confidently assigning the profile, though a slightly higher score could be achieved if the AI/ML aspects were more deeply integrated into the core tasks."
