While it mentions 'cutting-edge technology' and 'rule-based generative AI' in the introductory paragraph, the detailed responsibilities are all related to traditional QA processes like defect management, test documentation, and functional testing. There are no tasks described that involve developing, fine-tuning, or integrating AI models themselves, nor are there specific AI/ML technologies listed as requirements for the role. Therefore, the role is classified as a 'Software Engineer' as it does not involve AI/ML model development or integration."
