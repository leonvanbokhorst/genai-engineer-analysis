While it mentions exploring GenAI, LLM, and Copilots, these are listed as areas for exploration rather than core responsibilities. The primary focus remains on building and managing the underlying infrastructure and systems, with AI/GenAI being a potential area of integration or exploration within that framework, rather than the central focus of the role. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

The mention of GenAI, LLM, and Copilots is present but framed as an area for exploration rather than a primary task. This makes the classification of 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' quite confident, though not a perfect 5 due to the exploratory nature of the AI mentions."
