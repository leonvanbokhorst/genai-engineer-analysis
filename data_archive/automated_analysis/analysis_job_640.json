While it mentions GenAI, the core responsibilities are about integrating these capabilities into the software development lifecycle to enhance existing processes and products, rather than focusing on the deep technical aspects of model development or GenAI specialization itself. The role aims to boost efficiency and innovation across the board using AI, positioning it as a software engineering role that leverages AI, rather than a pure AI specialist role. There are no specific GenAI or traditional ML model development tasks mentioned, nor are there specific GenAI frameworks or models listed."
