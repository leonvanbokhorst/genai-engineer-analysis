While it mentions 'GenAI Copywriting Assistant', this appears to be one specific feature within a broader CRM development context, rather than the core focus of the role. The emphasis is on building and refining software that *uses* AI capabilities, rather than deep model development or AI specialization. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

The AI component is present but not the sole focus, making the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile a strong fit. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the depth of involvement with GenAI itself is not extensively detailed beyond mentioning one specific application."
