        "rationale": "The job advertisement focuses on designing, building, and maintaining automation solutions using tools like UiPath, Node-RED, and RobotFramework. While these are technical tasks, they do not involve AI/ML model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. The tasks fall squarely within Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering), specifically Software Development & Integration and Operations. There are no tasks from Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization). Therefore, the most appropriate profile is 'Software Engineer'."
