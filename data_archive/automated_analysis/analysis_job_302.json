    "profile": {

        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on tasks related to training and evaluating AI models, specifically generative AI models. Phrases like 'help train AI models', 'train AI large language models', and 'Evaluating and ranking code generated by AI models' clearly fall under Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization). There are no tasks mentioned that fall under Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering), such as building applications, developing APIs, or managing production infrastructure. While it mentions 'experienced software engineer', the core responsibilities are centered around the AI model training process itself, not software development or integration. Therefore, the 'ML Specialist (Data Scientist)' profile, with a strong emphasis on the 'GenAI Specialization' tasks, is the most appropriate fit."
    },
    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the core tasks involving AI model training and evaluation. However, it lacks specific details about the technologies used or the depth of involvement in model development versus data preparation. The mention of 'software engineer' could be interpreted in different ways, but the tasks described lean heavily towards model interaction and training rather than traditional software engineering. The absence of Macro-Category A tasks makes the profile assignment clearer, but the lack of technical specifics slightly reduces the confidence."
