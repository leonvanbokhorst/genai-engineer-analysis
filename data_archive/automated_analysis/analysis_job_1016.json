While it mentions leveraging AI and LLMs for 'Product Enhancement,' this is presented as a feature integration rather than the primary focus of the role. The majority of the responsibilities and technologies listed fall under Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering), with only a minor mention of AI/LLM application. Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

The mention of AI/LLMs is present but not the dominant theme, making the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile a strong fit. The confidence is high, but not perfect, as the depth of AI/LLM involvement is not extensively detailed."
