        "rationale": "The job ad focuses on implementing AI models into business processes and applications, with a specific mention of developing 'prompt flows' (1.B.2). However, the primary emphasis is on integration and testing within client environments (1.A.1), and collaboration on technical specifications (1.C.1). While GenAI specific tasks like prompt engineering are present, the role appears to be more about integrating these AI capabilities into existing software rather than deep model development or specialized GenAI research. The tasks lean more towards the 'Software Development & Integration' macro-category, making 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' the most fitting profile."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is reasonably clear about the core responsibilities, particularly the integration of AI models into client applications and the mention of prompt flows. However, it lacks specific details on the types of AI models or the depth of involvement in model development versus integration. The technologies used are not specified, which would have provided more clarity. Therefore, the confidence is high but not absolute."
