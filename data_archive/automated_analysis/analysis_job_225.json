While these products are 'AI-powered' and leverage 'cutting-edge AI technologies,' the job description does not detail any tasks related to building, fine-tuning, or directly managing AI models themselves (which would fall under Macro-Category B). The engineer's role is to build the software system that uses AI, creating an 'AI-powered feature or system.' This aligns perfectly with the definition of AI-Adjacent Software Engineer: 'Tasks are predominantly from Macro-Category A. The role builds or maintains software that directly uses or supports AI/ML models as a core part of its functionality. The output of their work is an AI-powered feature or system.'"

    "confidence": {
        "score": 5,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is exceptionally clear about the nature of the role being software engineering focused, with AI being a component of the product rather than the core deliverable of the engineer. The lack of specific AI model development tasks makes the classification straightforward and unambiguous."
