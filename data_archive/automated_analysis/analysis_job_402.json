        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on traditional software engineering tasks such as translating business demands into technical solutions, implementation, and production within agile teams (Macro-Category A). While it mentions working on data architecture projects involving NLP, time series modelling, and image recognition, and performing data analysis (Macro-Category B, specifically Data Engineering & Management), there is no explicit mention of developing, fine-tuning, or prompt engineering generative AI models. The core of the role appears to be building and integrating data solutions that may *support* AI/ML, rather than directly developing AI models themselves. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is reasonably clear about the core responsibilities being software development and data engineering. However, it is less explicit about the specific AI/ML techniques or models involved, making it slightly harder to pinpoint the exact nature of the AI involvement. The mention of NLP, time series, and image recognition suggests a broader AI/ML scope rather than a specific focus on GenAI."
