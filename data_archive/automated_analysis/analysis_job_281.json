        "rationale": "The job ad describes a balanced mix of core software engineering tasks (data pipelines, Linux server management) and AI specialization tasks. Specifically, it mentions 'GenAI Suite' and 'Klus Coach' (a generative AI assistant), indicating a focus on Generative AI. The role also involves managing Dataiku projects and supporting data science initiatives, which are data engineering tasks. The presence of both significant software engineering responsibilities (1.A.1, 1.A.2) and specific Generative AI tasks (1.B.2) alongside data engineering (1.B.3) points towards a 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile."
    },
    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to both data engineering and generative AI. While it doesn't explicitly mention LLM frameworks like LangChain or specific LLMs, the mention of 'GenAI Suite' and 'generatieve AI-assistent' strongly implies work in that domain. The inclusion of data pipelines and server management also solidifies the engineering aspect. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, due to the slight ambiguity in the exact nature of the 'GenAI Suite' and 'Klus Coach' without more context on the specific technologies used within them."
