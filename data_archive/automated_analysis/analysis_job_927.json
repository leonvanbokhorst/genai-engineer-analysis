While it mentions working with LLM and AI technologies, these are presented as part of the software solutions being developed rather than core AI model development or specialization tasks. This indicates the role is fundamentally a software engineering position that incorporates AI elements, fitting the AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is very clear about the software engineering focus and the integration of AI technologies. The 'Data Science' aspect of the title is not strongly supported by explicit tasks, but the mention of AI is sufficient to classify it as AI-Adjacent rather than a pure Software Engineer role. The lack of detail on specific AI tasks prevents a perfect score."
