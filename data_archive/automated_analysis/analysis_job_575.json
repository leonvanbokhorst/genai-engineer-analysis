        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on deploying and integrating machine learning models into production systems (1.A.1) and monitoring their performance (1.A.2). While it mentions understanding business requirements (1.C.1) and communication (3.1), there are no tasks related to the core development or fine-tuning of AI/ML models themselves (Macro-Category B). The emphasis is on the engineering and operational aspects of making AI work within existing software, rather than the AI research or model building itself. This aligns with the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to deployment, integration, and monitoring of ML models, which are strong indicators for the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile. However, it lacks specific details about the *type* of ML models or the *depth* of AI involvement, which prevents a perfect score. It also doesn't mention any specific technologies or GenAI-specific tasks."
