While it mentions serving 'AI capabilities' and working with 'LLM providers', it does not detail specific Generative AI model development, fine-tuning, or prompt engineering tasks. The emphasis is on the software engineering aspects that support AI, rather than the AI specialization itself. Therefore, the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile is the most fitting."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering responsibilities and mentions AI capabilities as a context for the backend work. However, it lacks specific details on the nature of the AI integration or the depth of AI-specific tasks, making it slightly less definitive than a role explicitly focused on AI model development. The profile assignment is strong based on the balance of tasks, but the AI aspect could be more explicit."
