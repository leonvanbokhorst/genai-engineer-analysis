Specifically, it emphasizes streamlining ML development processes, managing CI/CD, orchestration, experiment tracking, deployment, and infrastructure. While it mentions supporting research teams and establishing coding standards, there is no mention of specific Generative AI tasks (like LLMs, RAG, prompt engineering) or traditional ML model development/fine-tuning (like building predictive models, classifiers). Therefore, the role is primarily focused on the operational and engineering aspects of ML, but without a specific focus on GenAI, it aligns best with a 'Core ML Engineer' profile that supports ML workflows, even if the specific ML model types aren't detailed."

The focus is clearly on the operational side of ML."
