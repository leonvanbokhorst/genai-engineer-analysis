Data Engineering & Management. Additionally, it includes developing models with statistical methods for predictive analysis and optimization, which aligns with 1.B.1. Model Development & Fine-Tuning. All identified tasks fall under Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization) according to the provided coding book. Given that the tasks focus on traditional ML techniques (predictive analysis, statistical methods) rather than Generative AI, the most appropriate profile is ML Specialist (Data Scientist)."
