Crucially, it also explicitly requires building RAG solutions, which is a key Generative AI task from Macro-Category B. The mention of semantic search and vector databases further supports the GenAI focus. While there's a strong software engineering component, the specific inclusion of RAG and related technologies pushes it beyond an 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' role and into 'Core GenAI Engineer' due to the direct work with generative AI components."

The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the depth of the GenAI work is not as extensively detailed as the software engineering aspects, and the 'semantic search' mention could be interpreted in multiple ways, though RAG is explicit."
