While it mentions collaboration with data scientists and the development of data models for machine learning, the primary emphasis is on the engineering and infrastructure aspects of data, rather than the development or specialization in AI/ML models themselves. The mention of 'generative AI in risk summarization' within the team's scope indicates exposure to AI, but the described role is centered on the data engineering foundation that supports such initiatives, making it an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer role."

While it mentions AI/ML in the context of the team's work, the specific tasks described for the Data Engineer role are predominantly software engineering and data management focused. The confidence is high, but not perfect, as the role's direct involvement with AI/ML tasks could be more explicit within the described daily activities."
