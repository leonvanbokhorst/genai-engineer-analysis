While there are data pipeline setup tasks (1.B.3), the primary focus is on the operational and integration aspects of AI/ML, specifically mentioning LLM services. This balance leans towards a role that builds and maintains the infrastructure for AI, with a specific mention of LLM services, fitting the 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile due to the blend of A and B categories with a GenAI focus."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to MLOps, AWS, and LLM services, providing good evidence for classification. However, the term 'LLM Services' is somewhat general, and the depth of involvement in actual GenAI model development versus platform engineering is not explicitly detailed, leading to a slightly less than perfect confidence score."
