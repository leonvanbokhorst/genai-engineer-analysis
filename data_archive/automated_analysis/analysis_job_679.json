While it mentions integrating AI and real-time data processing, the core responsibilities and emphasis are on building robust, scalable, and high-quality code, implementing integrations, and delivering game systems. There is no mention of specific Generative AI tasks like prompt engineering, RAG, or fine-tuning LLMs, nor are traditional ML tasks like predictive modeling or classification detailed. The role is about building software that *uses* AI, rather than developing or specializing in AI models themselves. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."
