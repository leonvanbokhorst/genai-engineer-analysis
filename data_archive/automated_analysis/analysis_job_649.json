The mention of AWS (2.2) and CodeWhisperer (2.4) further supports the GenAI focus. While there are software engineering aspects (1.A.1, 1.A.2), the core tasks are centered around generative AI models and their application, indicating a balanced mix of AI specialization and software engineering, leaning towards GenAI."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to GenAI tools and system architecture. However, it lacks explicit mention of specific programming languages or detailed software development practices, which would have made the classification even more definitive. The tasks are well-aligned with the 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile."
