While AI, ML, GenAI, and NLP are mentioned as tools used to 'fix issues in robots', the primary tasks involve monitoring, drafting documents, and working with a team to develop and deploy these automations. The core of the role appears to be integrating and maintaining automated systems, rather than developing AI models from scratch or focusing on GenAI-specific tasks like prompt engineering or RAG. The mention of AI/ML/GenAI is in the context of *using* them to fix existing systems, not building new AI-centric products. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile, where AI/ML is a component integrated into a broader automation engineering function."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is clear about the internship nature and the core activities. However, the specific mention of 'AI and Machine learning, GenAI and Natural language processing' is brief and within the context of fixing issues, rather than defining the core of the role as AI development. This makes it slightly less definitive than a role explicitly focused on building AI models, but the overall context strongly points towards an adjacent role."
