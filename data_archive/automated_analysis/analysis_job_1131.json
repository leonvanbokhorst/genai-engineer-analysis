While there are mentions of AI model fine-tuning and prototyping (Macro-Category B tasks), these seem to be in service of improving the AI's performance within the support function, rather than core AI model development. The role is about applying AI to enhance an existing process, making it an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer role."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to integrating and improving AI systems within a support function. The distinction between core AI development and applying AI to solve business problems is evident. However, the specific technologies or methodologies are not detailed, and the role title 'Application Support Engineer' is not a standard AI/ML title, which slightly reduces confidence in a perfect classification without more context."
