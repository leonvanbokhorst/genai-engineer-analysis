        "rationale": "The job description heavily emphasizes core software engineering tasks such as building scalable data pipelines, cloud infrastructure, and production-ready applications. While it mentions 'AI Engineer' and 'leveraging LLMs', the specific responsibilities detailed are primarily focused on the engineering and infrastructure side (Macro-Category A), with less emphasis on model development, fine-tuning, or prompt engineering (Macro-Category B). The role involves integrating AI/ML features into solutions, but the core of the work appears to be in the engineering of the systems that support these features, aligning with the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines many software engineering responsibilities and lists relevant technologies. However, the initial sentence mentions 'leveraging LLMs' and 'AI Engineer' title, which could imply more direct AI/ML model work than is detailed in the responsibilities. The specific tasks are more infrastructure and pipeline focused, making the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile the most likely, but there's a slight ambiguity regarding the depth of direct AI model involvement."
