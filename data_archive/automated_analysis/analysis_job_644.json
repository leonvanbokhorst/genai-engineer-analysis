        "rationale": "The role focuses on integrating AI capabilities into customer support systems and improving existing AI models through feedback and fine-tuning. While there's involvement in AI model fine-tuning (1.B.1), the primary emphasis is on integrating these AI capabilities into a broader application (customer resolutions, customer support) and improving the system itself. There's no mention of developing AI models from scratch or deep specialization in generative AI techniques beyond improving existing systems. The tasks are more about applying and refining AI within a software context rather than core AI research or development."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines tasks related to AI integration and improvement within a support system. While it mentions 'AI model fine-tuning', the overall context points towards applying and enhancing existing AI rather than deep model development. The profile assignment is reasonably confident, but a slightly higher score would be warranted if there were more explicit details about the specific AI technologies or the depth of model interaction."
