        "rationale": "The job ad explicitly seeks an 'experienced software engineer' and mentions 'coding expertise' (Macro-Category A). The primary task described is 'train AI models' and 'helping cutting-edge generative AI models write better code' (Macro-Category B, specifically 1.B.1). While there is a clear AI component, the emphasis on leveraging existing software engineering skills to *train* models, rather than building the AI infrastructure or specializing deeply in GenAI techniques like prompt engineering or RAG, positions this role as AI-Adjacent. The core identity is that of a software engineer applying their skills to an AI task."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 3,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite brief and focuses heavily on the payment structure and contract details rather than specific technical responsibilities or required technologies. While it clearly indicates a software engineering background is needed to train AI models, the depth of AI involvement and the specific nature of the 'training' are not detailed, making it difficult to pinpoint a more specific profile within the AI/ML spectrum. The mention of 'generative AI models' is present, but the core task is described as 'training' which leans towards model development rather than advanced GenAI specialization."
