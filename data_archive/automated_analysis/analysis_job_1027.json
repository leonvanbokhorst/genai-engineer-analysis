While 'AI' is mentioned in the title and context of the software (NX CAM), there are no specific responsibilities or requirements related to building, fine-tuning, deploying, or integrating AI/ML models or generative AI technologies. The role also emphasizes collaboration and communication. Therefore, it aligns with the 'Software Engineer' profile, where AI is a domain context rather than a core technical skill requirement for the engineer."
