While it mentions utilizing generative AI (LLMs, RAG, Agents) and creating data pipelines for AI/ML, these are presented as features to be integrated into existing systems or as supporting tasks rather than the primary focus of model development or deep AI research. The role is described as a 'Full Stack Software Engineer - AI', indicating that AI is an augmentation to a core software engineering role. The balance leans significantly towards Macro-Category A, with specific AI/GenAI tasks falling under Macro-Category B but not dominating the description. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."
