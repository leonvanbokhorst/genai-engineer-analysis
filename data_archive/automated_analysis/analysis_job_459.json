While the role is within the data and analytics space (Databricks platform), there is no mention of specific AI/ML model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. The core responsibilities are about demonstrating and integrating a data platform, which is a software engineering function that supports data science and analytics, rather than directly building AI models. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to software integration and client interaction, but it does not delve into specific AI/ML model development tasks. The focus is on the Databricks platform and its integration capabilities. The absence of explicit AI/ML model-centric tasks makes the classification straightforward, but the lack of deep technical detail on the 'data science/ML' aspect prevents a perfect score."
