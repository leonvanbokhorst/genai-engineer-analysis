While several themes mention AI and ML tasks (Data Preparation using LLMs, AI & Machine Learning, MLOps, AI Governance), the core of the role is building and enhancing the Dataiku DSS platform and its features. The majority of the identified tasks fall under 'Software Development & Integration' (Macro-Category A), with specific AI/ML tasks being integrated into the broader software development context. The role is not primarily focused on deep AI model development or specialization but rather on integrating AI capabilities into a larger software product and managing the associated MLOps. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

The distinction between core software engineering and AI specialization is clear enough to assign a profile with high confidence, though the breadth of AI topics mentioned could lead to slight ambiguity if not carefully mapped to the definitions."
