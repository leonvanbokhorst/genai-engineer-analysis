While AI is mentioned as a focus for applications, the core responsibilities and required skills are centered around building and integrating these applications. There is no explicit mention of core ML model development, fine-tuning, or advanced GenAI specialization tasks like prompt engineering or RAG.

Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

The classification is strong, but there's a slight ambiguity regarding the depth of AI involvement."
