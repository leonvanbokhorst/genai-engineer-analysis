Phrases like 'help train AI models', 'train AI large language models', 'Crafting and answering questions related to computer science in order to help train AI models', and 'Evaluating and ranking code generated by AI models' all fall under Macro-Category B: GenAI Specialization, specifically 1.B.1 Model Development & Fine-Tuning. There are no tasks mentioned that fall under Macro-Category A: Core Software Engineering. While it mentions 'experienced software engineer', the core responsibilities are purely focused on the AI model training and evaluation aspect, making it a specialist role rather than an engineering role that integrates AI into a broader software product."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the core tasks being model training and evaluation. However, it lacks specific details about the technologies used or the depth of the software engineering experience required beyond a general mention. The profile assignment is strongly indicated by the task descriptions, but the absence of technical specifics prevents a perfect score."
