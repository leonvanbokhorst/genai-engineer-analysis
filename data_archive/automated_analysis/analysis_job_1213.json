The tasks and technologies listed (Ansible, Puppet, Terraform) are standard for DevOps and Infrastructure Engineering roles, which fall under Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering) without any elements from Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization). Therefore, the most appropriate profile is 'Software Engineer'."
