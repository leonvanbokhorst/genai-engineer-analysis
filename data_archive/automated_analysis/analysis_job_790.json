While it mentions 'generative AI' as something to advise on, the core responsibilities are centered around software development and data management (Macro-Category A), with a minor mention of AI as a technology to advise on rather than implement directly. There are no explicit tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG systems (Macro-Category B). Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

The mention of 'generative AI' is in the context of advising on it, not implementing it, which helps in classifying the role. However, the specific technologies for AI/ML are not detailed, and the primary focus remains on data processing and reporting. The confidence is high but not perfect due to the limited depth on AI implementation specifics."
