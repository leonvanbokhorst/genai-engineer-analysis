It explicitly states 'Coding or programming' is NOT part of the role. The tasks align well with the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the term 'Implementation Engineer' could sometimes imply deeper technical development, but the description clarifies this is not the case here."
