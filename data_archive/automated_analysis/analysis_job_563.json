While it mentions 'Machine Learning' and 'Data Science', there is no specific mention of Generative AI tasks or technologies. The emphasis is on the engineering and strategic advisory aspects of ML within client solutions, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile as it involves building and integrating AI/ML features into client-facing solutions, with a strong emphasis on the engineering and strategic advisory side rather than deep model development or GenAI specialization."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the responsibilities, focusing on leadership, client advisory, and ML pipeline implementation. However, it lacks specific technical tool mentions, which would have increased confidence. The distinction between traditional ML and GenAI is not explicitly made, but the tasks described lean towards general ML engineering and strategy rather than specific GenAI techniques."
