While it mentions AI technologies like LLMs and NLP, the core responsibilities are centered around the software engineering aspects of creating the user-facing application. There are no tasks described that involve model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG implementation (Macro-Category B). Therefore, the role is classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, as it builds software that directly uses AI features but does not focus on the AI model development itself."

The responsibilities are well-defined and clearly fall under software development and integration, with no significant AI specialization tasks mentioned. The distinction between building the interface for AI services and developing the AI services themselves is clear."
