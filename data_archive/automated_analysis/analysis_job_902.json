        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on generative AI tasks such as designing, implementing, and optimizing generative AI solutions, specifically mentioning RAG systems, LLMs, and vector databases. While there's a mention of ensuring models deliver what customers need (related to data management and business alignment), there are no explicit tasks related to traditional software engineering (Macro-Category A). Therefore, the role is predominantly focused on AI specialization within the GenAI domain."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite specific about the technologies and tasks related to Generative AI (RAG, LLMs, vector databases). However, it lacks detail on the software engineering aspects (Macro-Category A) and the specific nature of the 'optimization' or 'implementation' tasks. This makes it lean towards a specialist role but leaves some room for interpretation regarding the balance of software engineering vs. pure AI work."
