While it mentions 'AI model integration' and collaboration with AI/data science teams, the core responsibilities and listed technologies are firmly rooted in software development. There are no specific tasks or technologies related to the development, fine-tuning, or advanced application of Generative AI or traditional ML models themselves. Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, as it involves building software that integrates AI, rather than developing the AI models themselves."
