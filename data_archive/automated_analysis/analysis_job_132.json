        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on researching and improving a dialog system using deep learning and NLP techniques (1.B.1). While there are elements of introducing new architectures and creating products for users (1.A.1), the core emphasis is on the ML model development and research aspect. There is no mention of Generative AI specific tasks like prompt engineering or RAG. The collaboration with stakeholders (3.1) supports the integration aspect but doesn't shift the primary focus away from traditional ML/NLP model improvement."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to ML model research and improvement in NLP. It specifies the domain (dialog systems) and the types of tasks involved. However, it lacks explicit mention of specific technologies or tools, and the 'create products' part is a bit general, preventing a perfect score. The distinction between traditional ML and GenAI is clear as GenAI is not mentioned."
