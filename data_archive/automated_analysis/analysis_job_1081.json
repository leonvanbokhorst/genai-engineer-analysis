The role is primarily about software development that *uses* AI, rather than deep AI model development or specialization. There's no mention of training models, fine-tuning, or advanced AI research, which would point towards a Core ML/GenAI Engineer or Specialist profile. The tasks are predominantly from Macro-Category A, with AI integration being a feature of the software being built."
