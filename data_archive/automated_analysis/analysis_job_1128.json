        "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on integrating AI capabilities into customer support systems and improving existing AI models through feedback and fine-tuning. While there's mention of AI model fine-tuning and prototyping, the primary emphasis is on the application and enhancement of AI within a broader support engineering context, rather than core AI model development or deep GenAI specialization. The tasks lean more towards using and improving AI as part of a software system (Macro-Category A) with some elements of AI specialization (Macro-Category B), making 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' the most fitting profile."
    },
    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to AI integration and improvement within a support context. While it mentions AI model fine-tuning, the overall framing suggests an application-focused role rather than a deep AI research or development position. The 'What you will NOT be doing' section and the emphasis on self-sufficiency provide additional context. The confidence is high, but not perfect, as the term 'AI-Augmented Customer Resolutions' could be interpreted slightly differently, but the overall evidence points strongly to this profile."
