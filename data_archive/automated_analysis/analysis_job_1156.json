While it mentions specific AI tools like GPT-4 Vision and Amazon CodeWhisperer, the core responsibilities are rooted in traditional software engineering tasks (Macro-Category A), with the AI component serving as a feature or enhancement to be integrated. There are no explicit tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering tasks related to AI integration. However, it lacks specific details about the depth of AI model work or the specific types of AI solutions being built beyond 'automations', which could be interpreted in various ways. The mention of specific AI tools is limited. The confidence is high due to the strong emphasis on software development and integration, but not perfect due to the slight ambiguity in the 'AI automations' aspect."
