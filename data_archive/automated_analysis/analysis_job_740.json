While it mentions exploring GenAI, LLM, and Copilots, these are presented as areas for exploration rather than core responsibilities. There are no specific tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. The primary responsibilities fall under Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering), with no significant tasks from Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization). Therefore, the most appropriate profile is 'Software Engineer'."

The mention of GenAI/LLM is exploratory, not a primary focus. The confidence is high for the 'Software Engineer' profile, but not a perfect 5 because the mention of GenAI/LLM, even if exploratory, could imply a slight overlap or future direction that isn't fully detailed."
