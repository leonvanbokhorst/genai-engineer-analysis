        "rationale": "The job ad emphasizes 'Full Stack Developer AI with Cloud Expertise' and lists core software engineering tasks such as developing Generative AI applications, implementing AI applications, and working on both backend and frontend. It also includes setting up cloud environments (MLOps/DevOps). While it mentions Generative AI, the focus is on the development and integration of these applications into the broader organizational context and decision-making, rather than deep model development or specialization in GenAI techniques like prompt engineering or RAG. The role is primarily about building and integrating AI features into software, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines a software engineering role with AI integration and cloud expertise. The tasks described align well with the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile. However, it lacks specific details about the AI technologies or models used, and the depth of AI involvement beyond 'developing and implementing' applications, which prevents a perfect score."
