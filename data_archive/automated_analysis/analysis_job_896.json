While 'GenAI' is mentioned in the context of data sources for insights and reporting, there are no specific tasks related to developing, fine-tuning, or prompt engineering of GenAI models themselves (Macro-Category B). The role is about building and managing BI systems that may *use* GenAI data, rather than building GenAI systems. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

The mention of GenAI is in the context of data sources rather than core model development. The tasks are predominantly software engineering focused. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the exact nature of 'GenAI reporting' could be interpreted in slightly different ways, though the overall emphasis remains on BI solutions."
