        "assigned_profile": "GenAI Specialist",
        "rationale": "The job advertisement focuses exclusively on tasks related to training and evaluating generative AI models, such as creating questions for training and ranking generated code. These tasks fall under Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization) and do not involve any core software engineering activities (Macro-Category A). Therefore, the 'GenAI Specialist' profile is the most appropriate."
    },
    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly describes tasks related to generative AI model training and evaluation. However, it lacks specific technology mentions and explicit soft skills, and the title 'Big Data Engineer' is somewhat misleading given the described responsibilities. The confidence is high for the profile assignment based on the described tasks, but moderate due to the lack of detail and potential title mismatch."
