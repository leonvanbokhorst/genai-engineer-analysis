        "rationale": "The job ad emphasizes the use of generative AI to improve project delivery, customer communications, and validation of deliverables, aligning with Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration). While AI is central, the core tasks involve consulting, gathering requirements, advising, and configuring within a software platform, rather than developing or fine-tuning AI models themselves (Macro-Category B). The role focuses on integrating AI into existing consulting workflows and client services, making it an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer role."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the nature of the role, focusing on applying AI within a consulting framework rather than core AI development. However, it explicitly states 'Coding or programming' is NOT part of the role, which slightly shifts the emphasis away from traditional software engineering and more towards the application and integration of AI tools within a service delivery model. The tasks are well-defined, but the absence of explicit technical tools or programming languages prevents a perfect score."
