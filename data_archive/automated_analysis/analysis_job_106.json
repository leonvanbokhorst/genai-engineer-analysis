This strongly aligns with Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration). Additionally, it explicitly mentions extending support to 'generative AI and large scale models' and seeks experience in 'building and productionize large scaling models solving business problems,' which points to Macro-Category B (Model Development & Fine-Tuning) with a specific focus on GenAI. The blend of core software engineering for the platform and the explicit mention of GenAI model experience suggests a 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile."

The role seems to bridge both software development and AI model building, with a clear direction towards GenAI. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as some specific GenAI tasks like prompt engineering or RAG are not detailed, and the exact balance between software engineering and model development isn't quantified."
