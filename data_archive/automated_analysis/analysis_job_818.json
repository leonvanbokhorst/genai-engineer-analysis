The responsibilities heavily emphasize traditional software engineering tasks such as 'designing, developing, implementing, architecting, and scaling software solutions' (1.A.1) and 'operations of security services' (1.A.2). While ML/GenAI is mentioned as a technology being adopted for threat detection, the role does not involve developing, fine-tuning, or engineering prompts for these models. Instead, it focuses on building and operating systems that *use* ML/GenAI for security purposes. This aligns with the definition of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, where the primary focus is on software engineering tasks that integrate or support AI/ML models as a core part of the product's functionality."

        "score": 5,
        "reasoning": "The job advertisement is very clear about the nature of the role being a software engineering position with a specific domain focus (security) that leverages ML/GenAI. The responsibilities are well-defined and clearly fall into the software development and operations categories, with no indication of core ML/GenAI model development. This makes the profile assignment unambiguous."
