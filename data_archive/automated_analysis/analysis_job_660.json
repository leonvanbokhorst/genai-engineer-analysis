It's about using AI as a tool to improve a software delivery process."

While AI is mentioned as a tool to accelerate delivery, the core responsibilities do not involve developing, fine-tuning, or integrating AI/ML models themselves. The role is primarily about building and delivering BI solutions, fitting the 'Software Engineer' profile as it exclusively involves tasks from Macro-Category A without a specialization in AI/ML model development or integration."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the core responsibilities being related to Business Intelligence tools and client interaction. The mention of AI is secondary and framed as an accelerator for existing processes, not a core AI development task. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the phrase 'Use AI to accelerate the delivery' could be interpreted in slightly different ways, though the overall context strongly points to a non-AI-centric role."
