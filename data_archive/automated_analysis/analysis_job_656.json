        "rationale": "The job ad focuses on building and enhancing data workflows and visualizations (Tableau, Alteryx) and integrating AI to accelerate these existing business intelligence solutions. There are no tasks related to developing, fine-tuning, or specializing in AI/ML models themselves (Macro-Category B). The primary focus is on the software engineering aspects of delivering business intelligence solutions, with AI as an acceleration tool rather than the core subject of development. Therefore, it aligns with the 'Software Engineer' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines tasks related to data visualization, data pipeline development, and client interaction. The mention of AI is in the context of accelerating existing BI solutions, not developing AI models. While the term 'AI' is present, the core responsibilities are firmly rooted in traditional software engineering and business intelligence delivery. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the specific nature of the 'AI integration' could be more detailed."
