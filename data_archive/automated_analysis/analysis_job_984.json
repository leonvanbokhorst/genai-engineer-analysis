        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on tasks related to training and evaluating generative AI models ('help train AI models', 'train generative artificial intelligence models', 'Evaluating and ranking code generated by AI models'). While it mentions 'experienced software engineer', the core responsibilities are centered around the AI model's learning and output evaluation, not software development or integration into a larger system. There are no tasks related to software development (Macro-Category A). Therefore, the profile is 'GenAI Specialist'."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines tasks related to training and evaluating AI models, which strongly points towards a specialist role. However, it lacks specific technical details about the AI models or the exact nature of the evaluation, and the 'software engineer' background mentioned could be interpreted in multiple ways. The absence of explicit software engineering tasks (Macro-Category A) makes the 'GenAI Specialist' profile quite clear, but the lack of technical depth prevents a perfect score."
