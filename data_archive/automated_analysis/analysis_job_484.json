There is no mention of Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Learning (ML) tasks, models, or frameworks. All identified tasks fall under '1.A.1. Software Development & Integration', and no tasks from Macro-Category B are present. This aligns with the definition of a 'Software Engineer' profile, as the role involves software development but does not integrate AI/ML features."

While short, it explicitly states the nature of the work (automation solutions) and the tools used, leaving no ambiguity about the absence of AI/ML components. The classification is straightforward based on the provided coding book."
