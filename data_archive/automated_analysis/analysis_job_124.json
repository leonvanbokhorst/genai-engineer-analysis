        "rationale": "The job ad primarily focuses on developing online creations, marketing campaigns, and creative concepts (Macro-Category A). While it mentions 'Generative AI' as an area for innovative solutions, the core responsibilities lean heavily towards traditional software development and creative output rather than deep AI/ML model development or specialization. The role is about building solutions that *might* involve Generative AI, rather than being solely focused on the AI aspect itself."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is relatively clear about the development and creative tasks. The mention of Generative AI is present but not the central focus, making the classification as 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' reasonably confident. However, it's not a 5 because the specific tasks within Generative AI are not detailed, leaving some room for interpretation."
