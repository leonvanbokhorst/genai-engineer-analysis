While it mentions leveraging AI and generative AI for specific product features (TeachTap, Educational Content Generation, Coachbot) and for boosting productivity, the core responsibilities and the majority of the listed technologies (Angular, React, React Native, AWS) are focused on software development and integration rather than deep AI model development or specialization. The role integrates AI into products but does not appear to be primarily focused on the AI models themselves."

The AI aspect is present but seems to be an enhancement to the core software product rather than the primary focus of the role itself. The profile assignment is clear, but a slightly higher score could be given if there were more explicit details on the AI model development or fine-tuning aspects."
