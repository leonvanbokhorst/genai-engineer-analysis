While 'ML/AI' and 'LLMs' are mentioned, the core responsibilities revolve around the Spark ecosystem, data integration, and platform support, rather than developing or fine-tuning AI models themselves. The role is about integrating and supporting AI/ML capabilities within a broader platform, making it an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer role."

The mention of AI/ML and LLMs is present but appears to be in the context of the platform's capabilities rather than the core development of generative models. The role is well-defined within the software engineering domain, leading to high confidence in the profile assignment."
