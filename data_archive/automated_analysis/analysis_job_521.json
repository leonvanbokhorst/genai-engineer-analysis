While it mentions AI/ML/GenAI and NLP, the core responsibility appears to be the engineering and maintenance of automated systems that *use* these technologies, rather than the deep development or specialization within AI/ML models themselves. The tasks are predominantly from Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration), with some elements from Macro-Category B (Model Development & Fine-Tuning) but not to the extent of a 'Core' role. The role is an internship, which often involves learning and supporting existing processes."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the internship's focus on automation engineering and the use of AI/ML/GenAI within that context. However, the specific mention of 'AI and Machine learning, GenAI and Natural language processing' is somewhat broad and could imply deeper involvement than just fixing issues. The primary classification leans towards AI-Adjacent Software Engineer due to the emphasis on automation development and deployment, but there's a slight ambiguity regarding the depth of AI/ML work."
