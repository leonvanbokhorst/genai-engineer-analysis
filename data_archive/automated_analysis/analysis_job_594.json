        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on software development, integration, and maintenance tasks (Macro-Category A), specifically mentioning 'GenAI services' as the component being developed and integrated. There are no explicit tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). The role is about building and integrating AI services into a product, rather than specializing in the AI models themselves. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."
