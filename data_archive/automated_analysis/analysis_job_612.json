While it mentions 'Generative AI' in the context of other companies (likely from scraped data), the core responsibilities described for this specific role involve traditional ML tasks like developing algorithms and automating processes, which aligns with 'Core ML Engineer'. The tasks are predominantly in Macro-Category B (Model Development & Fine-Tuning) and Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration) without a specific focus on Generative AI technologies like LLMs or RAG."

This makes it challenging to definitively classify the role's primary focus without more context. The core tasks described lean towards traditional ML/algorithm development rather than GenAI."
