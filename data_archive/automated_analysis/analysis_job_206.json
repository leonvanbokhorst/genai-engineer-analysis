While it mentions 'generative AI at our core' and lists AI-driven products, the responsibilities described do not involve model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG implementation (Macro-Category B). The role is about building software that *uses* AI, rather than building the AI itself. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

However, it lacks specific details about the AI technologies or tasks involved, making it slightly less definitive than an ad that explicitly details model building or GenAI framework usage. The confidence is high because the software engineering aspects are very clear."
