        "rationale": "The job ad focuses entirely on tasks related to training and evaluating generative AI models, specifically through providing feedback on code. While it mentions 'software-engineer' in the initial hook, the core responsibilities described (making/answering CS questions for AI training, evaluating AI-generated code) fall under the 'GenAI Specialization' macro-category (1.B.1. Model Development & Fine-Tuning). There are no tasks related to core software engineering (Macro-Category A). Therefore, the profile is 'GenAI Specialist'."

        "score": 5,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is very clear about the specific tasks involved in training and evaluating generative AI models. Although it's in Dutch, the technical concepts are unambiguous and directly map to the 'GenAI Specialization' category, particularly 'Model Development & Fine-Tuning'. The absence of any core software engineering tasks makes the profile assignment straightforward."
