While it mentions 'AI-powered security platform' and 'Leverage AI models and algorithms to transform threat defense', the core responsibilities described are about building and integrating these capabilities into existing systems rather than developing the AI models themselves. There are no specific tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). Therefore, the role is classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering responsibilities and mentions AI integration. However, it lacks specific details about the AI models or techniques to be used, making it slightly less definitive than an ad that would detail GenAI-specific tasks. The focus is clearly on the software engineering aspect of an AI-powered platform."
