There is only one task clearly falling under Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration for integrating solutions into products). The explicit focus on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) aligns with Generative AI. Therefore, the profile is GenAI Specialist."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to AI/ML model development, research, and data handling, with a specific focus on LLMs and NLP. However, it lacks specific mentions of technologies (tools, frameworks, platforms), which would have provided more definitive classification. The distinction between model deployment as part of development versus MLOps is slightly nuanced, but the overall emphasis on model-centric tasks is clear."
