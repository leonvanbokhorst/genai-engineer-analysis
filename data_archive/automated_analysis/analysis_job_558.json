While AI concepts are mentioned, the core responsibilities revolve around building scalable applications, creating custom functions, and improving development methodologies. There is no indication of tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or specific GenAI frameworks. The role is about building software that *uses* AI, rather than specializing in AI model creation or advanced GenAI techniques. Therefore, it aligns best with the AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is clear about the development focus and the tools used. It explicitly mentions 'AI applications' and 'AI-concepten', but the core tasks are software development. The absence of any mention of specific AI model development, fine-tuning, or GenAI-specific frameworks makes the classification straightforward. The only slight ambiguity could be the depth of 'AI' involvement, but the context strongly suggests integration rather than core AI engineering."
