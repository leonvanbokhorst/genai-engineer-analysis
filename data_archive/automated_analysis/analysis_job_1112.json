        "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on traditional software engineering tasks such as system configuration, maintenance, incident management, and implementing/managing systems. While AI tools are mentioned as a means to achieve these goals, the core responsibilities do not involve developing or fine-tuning AI models themselves, nor do they focus on prompt engineering or RAG. The role is about using AI to enhance existing operational processes, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile. However, given the lack of explicit AI model development or deep AI specialization tasks, and the emphasis on system configuration and operational efficiency through AI tools, it leans more towards a traditional Software Engineer role that leverages AI rather than a role focused on AI development itself. The tasks are primarily within Macro-Category A."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the responsibilities, distinguishing itself from traditional engineering roles. It emphasizes the use of AI tools for operational tasks rather than AI model development. The tasks described align well with software engineering and system operations, making the classification relatively straightforward. However, the specific mention of 'AI System Building' could be interpreted in multiple ways, slightly reducing absolute certainty."
