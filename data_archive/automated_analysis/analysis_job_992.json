The core responsibilities involve interacting with and providing feedback to AI models ('helpen geavanceerde generatieve AI-modellen betere code te schrijven', 'interactie vereisen met deze modellen terwijl ze leren coderen', 'Het maken en beantwoorden van vragen met betrekking tot informatica om AI-modellen te helpen trainen', 'Het evalueren en rangschikken van code die door AI-modellen wordt gegenereerd'). There are no explicit mentions of traditional software engineering tasks like building applications, microservices, or managing production infrastructure (Macro-Category A). Therefore, the role is predominantly focused on AI specialization, specifically Generative AI, making 'GenAI Specialist' the most appropriate profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the core tasks related to AI model training and evaluation, specifically for generative AI. However, it lacks detail on the specific technologies or frameworks used, and the 'software engineer' framing in the introduction might be slightly misleading given the actual tasks described. The tasks are predominantly in Macro-Category B (AI Specialization), with a focus on GenAI, leading to the 'GenAI Specialist' profile. The confidence is high, but not perfect, due to the limited technical detail and the initial framing."
