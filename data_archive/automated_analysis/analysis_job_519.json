Software Development & Integration'. There is no mention of any tasks or technologies related to Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization). According to the coding book's profile definitions, a role exclusively focused on Macro-Category A without AI/ML components is classified as a Software Engineer. While the prompt's context is AI/ML roles, the ad itself does not describe an AI/ML role. Therefore, the 'Software Engineer' profile is assigned based on the direct interpretation of the ad against the coding book's categories, acknowledging the absence of AI/ML specific content."

        "reasoning": "The job advertisement is extremely brief and lacks any descriptive details about responsibilities, required skills, or technologies. The analysis is based solely on the job title 'Interim Senior Full Stack Developer,' which provides minimal information. It's impossible to determine if there are any underlying AI/ML components or specific tasks without a proper job description."
