        "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on traditional data engineering tasks such as ETL processes, Lakehouse development, and the use of Python and SQL. While it mentions awareness of GenAI and the ability to translate it into applications, the core responsibilities and technologies listed (ETL, Lakehouse, CI/CD, Python, SQL, Azure) are primarily related to software engineering and data infrastructure. The role is about building and maintaining the data foundation and integrating AI capabilities, rather than developing AI models themselves. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile, where the primary focus is on software engineering with an AI component."
    },
    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines core data engineering responsibilities and mentions relevant technologies. The mention of GenAI is present but not the primary focus of the tasks described. The profile assignment is straightforward based on the emphasis on software engineering tasks over specialized AI model development. A slightly lower score is given because the description of the GenAI aspect is brief, leaving some room for interpretation on the depth of AI involvement."
