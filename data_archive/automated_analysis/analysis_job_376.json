        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on traditional machine learning tasks such as 'algorithm development and implementation', 'data exploration and modeling', and 'analyzing and interpreting results'. While it mentions 'Generative AI' as an emerging technology the team explores, the core responsibilities are rooted in the broader ML lifecycle, including pipeline development, deployment, and MLOps. The tasks are balanced between core software engineering (1.A.1, 1.A.2) and ML specialization (1.B.1, 1.B.3), but the specialization leans towards traditional ML rather than exclusively GenAI. Therefore, 'Core ML Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to the ML lifecycle, MLOps, and collaboration. It provides a good balance of task descriptions. However, the mention of 'Generative AI' as an area of exploration, without it being a primary focus of the described tasks, introduces a slight ambiguity in distinguishing between a Core ML Engineer and a Core GenAI Engineer. The role seems to be more grounded in traditional ML with an openness to GenAI."
