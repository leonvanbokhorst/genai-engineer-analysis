While there's a strong software engineering component, the core focus is on Generative AI tasks and the infrastructure to support them. The role also involves leadership and strategic input (1.C.1), and significant collaboration (3.1) and ownership/mentorship (3.5). The explicit mention of 'Generative AI', 'LLMs', and 'small language and vision models' points towards a GenAI specialization. Given the balance between core software engineering tasks (integration, infrastructure) and AI specialization (GenAI, LLMs), and the leadership expectations, 'Core GenAI Engineer' is the most fitting profile."
