        "rationale": "The job description heavily emphasizes software engineering tasks such as automating processes, building and managing data pipelines, and integrating data into existing tools (PowerApps). While it mentions 'data modelling', 'data science', and 'GenAI', these appear to be areas where automation and data integration are applied, rather than the core focus of developing novel AI models. The role is positioned as a 'trusted business partner' driving the 'D&A strategy' and 'automation', suggesting the primary output is enhanced business processes through technology, rather than the creation of AI models themselves. The tasks lean more towards Macro-Category A (Software Engineering) with applications of AI/ML concepts, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines automation and data pipeline tasks, which are strong indicators of software engineering. The mention of GenAI is present but not as the central focus of model development. The role's emphasis on business partnership and strategy also helps in profiling. However, the specific nature of the 'GenAI' tasks isn't deeply detailed, leaving a slight ambiguity about the depth of AI model work versus AI-enabled automation."
