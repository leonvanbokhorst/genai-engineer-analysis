        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on tasks related to training and evaluating AI models, specifically generative AI models that write code. Phrases like 'help train AI models', 'Crafting and answering questions related to computer science in order to help train AI models', and 'Evaluating and ranking code generated by AI models' all fall under Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization), specifically 'Model Development & Fine-Tuning' (1.B.1). There are no tasks mentioned that fall under Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering). While it mentions 'experienced software engineer', the core responsibilities are AI-centric and do not involve building or integrating AI into software products (1.A.1) or MLOps (1.A.2). Therefore, the profile leans towards a specialist role focused on the AI model training aspect."
    },
    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the core tasks related to AI model training and evaluation. However, it lacks specific details about the technologies used or the depth of the software engineering experience required beyond 'lending coding expertise'. The absence of Macro-Category A tasks makes the profile assignment clearer, but the lack of technical specifics slightly reduces confidence from a perfect score."
