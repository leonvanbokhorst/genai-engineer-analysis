        "rationale": "The job ad heavily emphasizes traditional software engineering tasks (1.A.1) such as developing back-end solutions, integrating features, building widgets, optimizing functionality, and conducting code reviews. While it mentions AI tools, RAG, GPT-4, and implementing ML algorithms, these are presented as features to be integrated into existing product lines or used to enhance development efficiency, rather than the primary focus of model development or deep AI research. The role is about building and maintaining software that *uses* AI, fitting the description of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

        "score": 5,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is very clear about the nature of the work, detailing specific product lines and the types of tasks involved. The emphasis on software development, integration, and modernization using AI as a tool, rather than core AI research or model building, makes the profile assignment straightforward and highly confident."
