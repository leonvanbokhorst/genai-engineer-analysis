Key tasks include 'implementeren en onderhouden van onze machine learning infrastructuur en workflows' (1.A.2) and ensuring 'naadloze overgang van ontwikkeling naar productie' (1.A.1). While the role is MLOps-focused, the context of generative AI and working with NLP specialists suggests a strong connection to the GenAI domain. The emphasis on infrastructure and workflows (Macro-Category A) is clear, but the domain is GenAI. Given the explicit mention of generative AI and the MLOps nature, it leans towards a 'Core GenAI Engineer' as it bridges the gap between software engineering practices (MLOps) and the GenAI domain, rather than being purely a specialist in model development or purely a software engineer integrating AI."
    },
    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly states the focus on generative AI and the MLOps nature of the role. The tasks and collaboration aspects are well-defined. However, there are no specific GenAI technologies or models mentioned, and the tasks are primarily infrastructure-focused, which could also fit a more general MLOps role. The confidence is high but not perfect due to the lack of explicit GenAI tool mentions."
