While it includes a specific Generative AI task ('Build RAG solutions'), the majority of the described tasks fall under traditional software development and operations. The title 'Software Engineer' also supports this classification. Therefore, the role is best described as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, as it integrates AI/ML features into a broader software engineering context."
