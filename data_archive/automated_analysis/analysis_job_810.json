While it mentions 'cutting-edge technology' and 'data privacy dilemma', these are contextual elements for the business strategy rather than core technical responsibilities. There are no tasks or technologies related to AI/ML model development, integration, or specialized AI engineering as defined in the coding book. Therefore, the role falls outside the scope of AI/ML engineering profiles."

The language used is consistently focused on commercial activities, market penetration, and sales processes. There is no ambiguity regarding the nature of the role."
