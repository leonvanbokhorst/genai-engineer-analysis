While it mentions leveraging AI tools and integrating AI-driven solutions, it does not detail specific Generative AI tasks like model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG implementation (Macro-Category B). The primary output of the role is software enhanced by AI, rather than the AI models themselves. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

However, it lacks specific details on the *type* of AI or generative AI techniques being used, making it slightly less definitive than a role explicitly detailing LLM work. The emphasis is on using AI as a tool for software development, aligning well with the AI-Adjacent profile."
