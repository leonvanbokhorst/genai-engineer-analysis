These activities fall under Macro-Category A (specifically 1.A.1. Software Development & Integration) as they are integral to ensuring the security and robustness of software systems. The role does not involve developing, fine-tuning, or integrating AI/ML models, nor does it focus on the specific tasks of Generative AI or traditional ML specialization (Macro-Category B). The mention of 'GenAI features' is contextual to the devices being secured, not the core function of the engineer. Therefore, the profile 'Software Engineer' is the most appropriate fit."
