The core tasks involve advising, managing, and developing tools to automate and optimize legal workflows, which aligns with Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration). While AI and generative AI are mentioned as areas of investigation and application, the primary emphasis is on applying these technologies to improve existing business processes and service delivery within the legal domain, rather than deep model development or specialization in GenAI itself. There's a strong emphasis on understanding the legal context and collaborating with legal professionals, indicating the role is about enhancing existing services with AI rather than building AI products from scratch. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile, where the software engineering aspect of integrating and managing tech solutions is dominant, with AI being a key component of those solutions."

It mentions AI and generative AI, but the core tasks are about process improvement, tool management, and integration, which are well-defined. The profile assignment is clear based on the emphasis on integration and business process improvement rather than deep AI model development. A slightly lower score is given because the specific technical tools or programming languages are not mentioned, and the depth of AI involvement is described more in terms of application and investigation rather than hands-on model building."
