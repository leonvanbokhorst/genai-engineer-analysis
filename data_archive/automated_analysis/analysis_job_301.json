        "rationale": "The job advertisement focuses heavily on tasks related to training, evaluating, and refining AI models, specifically generative AI models. Phrases like 'help train AI models', 'train AI large language models', and 'Evaluating and ranking code generated by AI models' clearly fall under Macro-Category B: GenAI Specialization, specifically within 'Model Development & Fine-Tuning' (1.B.1). There are no tasks mentioned that fall under Macro-Category A: Core Software Engineering. While it mentions 'experienced software engineer', the core responsibilities are about the AI model training process itself, not about integrating these models into software applications or managing their deployment infrastructure. Therefore, the role is predominantly focused on the AI specialization aspect, leading to the 'ML Specialist (Data Scientist)' profile, with a specific emphasis on Generative AI."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is clear about the core tasks involving AI model training and evaluation. However, it lacks specific technical tool mentions and doesn't detail the software engineering aspects that would be needed for other profiles. The profile assignment is strongly supported by the task descriptions, but the absence of technology specifics prevents a perfect score."
