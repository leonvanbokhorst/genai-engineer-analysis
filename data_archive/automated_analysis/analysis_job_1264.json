        "rationale": "The job ad focuses on 'fine-tuning AI/ML models' and 'building vehicle assistant response quality evaluation tools', which are core ML tasks. It also includes building data pipelines and maintaining production systems, indicating a blend of ML specialization and software engineering operations. However, there is no mention of Generative AI specific tasks like LLMs, RAG, or prompt engineering. Therefore, the role aligns best with a 'Core ML Engineer'."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the tasks involved, particularly the focus on fine-tuning models and building data pipelines. The absence of explicit Generative AI terms makes the classification towards 'Core ML Engineer' straightforward. However, the lack of specific technologies mentioned prevents a perfect score."
