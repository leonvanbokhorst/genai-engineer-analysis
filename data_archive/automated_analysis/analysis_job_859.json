While 'generative AI' is mentioned as a technical area for training, the core responsibilities and technologies listed are primarily within Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration). There are no explicit tasks related to building, fine-tuning, or deploying generative AI models themselves (Macro-Category B). Therefore, the role is classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, where AI is a component being integrated or learned about, rather than the primary focus of the engineering work."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is clear about the software engineering nature of the role and mentions generative AI as a learning/integration area. However, it lacks specific details on how generative AI will be applied in practice, making it slightly less definitive than a role explicitly focused on GenAI tasks. The emphasis is clearly on software engineering with an AI component."
