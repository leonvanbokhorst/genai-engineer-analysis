While it mentions AI technologies and automation, it lacks specific mentions of Generative AI concepts like LLMs, RAG, or prompt engineering. The tasks lean more towards building and implementing ML models rather than integrating them into user-facing applications as a core feature (AI-Adjacent Software Engineer) or focusing solely on GenAI specifics (GenAI Specialist/Core GenAI Engineer). Therefore, 'Core ML Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

However, it lacks specific details about the types of AI models or the explicit mention of Generative AI technologies, making it slightly less definitive than a role explicitly mentioning LLMs or GenAI. The focus is on 'AI automation' and 'machine learning models' in a general sense."
