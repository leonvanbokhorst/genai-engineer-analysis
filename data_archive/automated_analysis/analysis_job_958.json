Phrases like 'help train AI models', 'Crafting and answering questions related to computer science in order to help train AI models', and 'Evaluating and ranking code generated by AI models' all fall under 'Model Development & Fine-Tuning' (1.B.1). There are no tasks related to software development, integration, or MLOps (Macro-Category A). The role is about directly interacting with and improving AI models, not building software around them. While it mentions 'experienced software engineer', the core tasks are AI-centric and do not involve traditional software engineering practices. Therefore, it aligns best with a specialist role focused on the AI model itself, specifically in the generative AI domain, making 'ML Specialist (Data Scientist)' the closest fit, though it leans towards GenAI tasks."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is clear about the core tasks involving training and evaluating AI models. However, it lacks specific technical details (like specific models or tools) and doesn't explicitly use the term 'Generative AI' beyond mentioning 'generative artificial intelligence models' in one bullet point. The profile assignment is strong based on the task descriptions, but the lack of technical specifics prevents a perfect score."
