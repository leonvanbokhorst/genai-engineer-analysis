        "assigned_profile": "Core ML Engineer",
        "rationale": "The job ad explicitly mentions building traditional machine learning models for tasks like marketing attribution, customer propensity, and segmentation (1.B.1). It also includes fine-tuning Large Language Models (1.B.1), indicating a mix of traditional ML and GenAI. The role also involves designing and architecting solutions, integrating and deploying AI solutions (1.A.1), and deploying MLOps pipelines (1.A.2). The presence of both traditional ML tasks and GenAI tasks, along with significant software engineering and MLOps components, points towards a 'Core ML Engineer' profile, with a strong leaning towards GenAI capabilities as well. Given the explicit mention of both traditional ML and LLM fine-tuning, and the emphasis on building and deploying models and pipelines, it leans more towards a core ML role that also incorporates GenAI, rather than a pure GenAI specialist or an AI-adjacent software engineer. However, the inclusion of LLM fine-tuning makes it a hybrid. Re-evaluating, the balance between traditional ML (marketing attribution, propensity, segmentation) and GenAI (LLM fine-tuning) is present. The software engineering aspects (design/architect solutions, integration, deployment, MLOps) are also significant. This mix of traditional ML, GenAI, and strong SE/MLOps components fits the 'Core ML Engineer' profile best, as it doesn't exclusively focus on GenAI but includes it alongside traditional ML. If the LLM fine-tuning was the dominant task, 'Core GenAI Engineer' might be considered, but the emphasis on traditional ML tasks is also strong."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines a mix of traditional ML tasks and GenAI tasks, along with software engineering and MLOps responsibilities. The profile assignment is well-supported by the text. However, the exact balance between traditional ML and GenAI could be slightly more explicit to achieve a perfect score, but the overall clarity is high."
