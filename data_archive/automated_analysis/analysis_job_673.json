While it mentions AI/ML algorithms, RAG, and GPT-4, these are presented as features to be integrated into existing products rather than the primary focus of model development or deep AI research. The role is about building software that *uses* AI, not primarily about building the AI itself. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."
