        "rationale": "The job advertisement focuses entirely on traditional software engineering tasks related to mobile app development using Flutter and Dart. While it mentions interaction with an 'AI-powered platform' and a reference to Generative AI in the 'amazing stuff we do on the tech side' section, the core responsibilities and required skills are purely software development. There are no tasks related to building, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or managing AI/ML models themselves. Therefore, the role is classified as a 'Software Engineer' as it does not involve AI/ML specialization."
