While it mentions exploring 'Neuro Symbolic AI' and interfacing with an 'LLM', these are presented as exploratory or future directions rather than the primary day-to-day responsibilities. The core of the role is building and scaling a data pipeline product using Java, with AI integration being a secondary, albeit important, aspect. This aligns with the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile, where the role is primarily software engineering but integrates AI/ML features into its functionality."

The distinction between the primary focus (Java development, architecture) and the secondary focus (AI exploration) is evident, allowing for a confident profile assignment. However, the 'exploring' nature of the AI part means it's not a fully defined AI role, hence not a perfect 5."
