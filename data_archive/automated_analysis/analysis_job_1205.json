While AI/ML infrastructure is mentioned (NVIDIA DGX, Azure, etc.), the core responsibilities are about supporting users and optimizing existing applications and workflows rather than developing new AI models or GenAI-specific features (Macro-Category B tasks are absent). The role is about enabling others to use AI/ML effectively within a provided infrastructure, fitting the profile of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

It lacks any mention of core AI/ML model development or GenAI specialization tasks. The focus is on the 'application and workflow side' of AI/HPC infrastructure. This makes the classification relatively straightforward, though the 'AI/ML Application Support Engineer' title could be interpreted in slightly different ways, hence not a perfect 5."
