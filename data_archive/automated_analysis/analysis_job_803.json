Given the options, it leans towards the application and responsible use of models."

        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on traditional ML tasks such as 'statistical models', 'predictive algorithms', and 'revealing hidden patterns'. While it mentions 'generative AI' in a question, the core responsibilities described are about developing and operationalizing end-to-end solutions using traditional ML techniques. The emphasis is on building robust, production-ready models and creating business value, aligning with the 'Core ML Engineer' profile which has a balanced mix of Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration) and Macro-Category B (Model Development & Fine-Tuning) tasks focused on traditional ML."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines traditional ML tasks and the need for operationalizing solutions. The mention of 'generative AI' is in the context of a question about its ethical and safe deployment, rather than a primary task. This makes the classification towards 'Core ML Engineer' quite strong, but the explicit mention of GenAI prevents a perfect score."
