There are no specific mentions of AI/ML model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, RAG, or any generative AI-specific technologies or tasks. The mention of 'Data & Machine Learning Engineer' in the title seems to be a misnomer given the responsibilities listed, which are purely software engineering focused."
