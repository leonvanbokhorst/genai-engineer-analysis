While it mentions 'building systems', it explicitly states 'Coding or programming' is NOT part of the role. The core responsibilities revolve around consulting, advising, and configuring within a software platform, all augmented by AI. This aligns with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile, where AI is integrated into the product/service delivery but the individual is not primarily developing the core AI models or the underlying software infrastructure from scratch. The emphasis is on applying AI to consulting tasks rather than building AI systems themselves."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the nature of the role, emphasizing the application of AI in consulting and explicitly stating that coding is not required. However, the term 'Implementation Engineer' and 'building systems' could be interpreted in different ways, leading to a slightly lower confidence than a perfect 5. The distinction between configuring within a platform and core software development is key here."
