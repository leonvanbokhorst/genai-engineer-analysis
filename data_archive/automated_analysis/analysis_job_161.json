        "rationale": "The job title 'Medior Back End Engineer' clearly indicates a role focused on traditional software development tasks related to building and maintaining the server-side logic of applications. There is no mention of AI or ML responsibilities, aligning it with the `Software Engineer` profile, which is characterized by tasks exclusively from Macro-Category A."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 2,
        "reasoning": "The job advertisement is extremely brief, containing only a job title. While the title 'Medior Back End Engineer' unambiguously points to a `Software Engineer` profile, there are no specific phrases or details provided to analyze job tasks, technologies, or soft skills according to the `CODING_BOOK.md`'s detailed categories. Therefore, the analysis is limited to inferring the profile from the title alone, leading to a low confidence in the depth of the analysis."
