The product explicitly leverages generative AI and LLMs, indicating that AI/ML is a key component of the system being built. However, the primary responsibilities described are centered around frontend development and integration, not the development, fine-tuning, or deep specialization in AI models themselves (Macro-Category B). Therefore, the role is classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

It mentions the use of 'generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs)' as technologies the product leverages, but the focus remains on the frontend development aspect. The distinction between building the interface for an AI-powered product and being an AI specialist is clear. The confidence is high, but not perfect, as there's always a slight possibility of deeper AI integration implied by 'leveraging technologies'."
