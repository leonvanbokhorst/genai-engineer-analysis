        "rationale": "The job ad emphasizes developing LLM-based solutions (1.B.1), contributing to LLM Ops (1.A.2), and delivering text analytics solutions (1.A.1). It also requires translating business requirements (1.C.1) and strong communication/collaboration skills (3.1). The focus on LLMs, prompt tuning, and fine-tuning, combined with operational aspects (LLM Ops) and integration into business solutions, points to a balanced role between Generative AI specialization and core software engineering practices. Therefore, 'Core GenAI Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is very clear about the responsibilities, technologies (LLMs, prompt tuning, fine-tuning, LLM Ops), and the type of solutions to be developed. The tasks clearly fall into both Macro-Category A (LLM Ops, delivering solutions) and Macro-Category B (developing LLM-based solutions, prompt tuning, fine-tuning). The soft skills are also explicitly mentioned. This clarity makes the analysis straightforward and highly confident."
