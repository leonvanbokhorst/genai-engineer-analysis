It also emphasizes developing 'end-to-end solutions' and 'robust solutions that are used in production' (1.A.1), indicating a blend of ML specialization and software engineering. The mention of 'generative AI' in a question about deployment and ethics, rather than core development, suggests it's an area of interest or application rather than the primary focus. The role is not exclusively software engineering (1.A.1) nor purely ML/GenAI specialization (B), but a balanced mix leaning towards traditional ML."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to traditional ML and operationalizing solutions. The inclusion of a question about generative AI adds a slight nuance, but the core tasks described are more aligned with traditional ML engineering. The confidence is high, but not perfect, due to the explicit mention of 'generative AI' which could imply a broader scope than just traditional ML."
