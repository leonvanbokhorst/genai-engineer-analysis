        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on tasks related to training and evaluating generative AI models, specifically by creating and answering computer science questions and assessing AI-generated code. While it mentions 'software-engineer' in the introduction, the core responsibilities described fall under the 'GenAI Specialization' macro-category (Macro-Category B), with no mention of traditional software development or integration tasks (Macro-Category A). Therefore, the 'GenAI Specialist' profile is the most appropriate fit."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines tasks related to training and evaluating generative AI models. However, it's a bit light on specific technical details or the broader software engineering context, which prevents a perfect score. The profile assignment is strongly supported by the described tasks."
