Phrases like 'train AI models', 'train generative artificial intelligence models', 'Crafting and answering questions related to computer science in order to help train AI models', and 'Evaluating and ranking code generated by AI models' all fall under Macro-Category B: GenAI Specialization, specifically 'Model Development & Fine-Tuning' (1.B.1). There are no explicit mentions of software development, integration, or MLOps tasks (Macro-Category A). While it mentions 'experienced software engineer', the core responsibilities are centered around the AI model training and evaluation process, making it a specialist role rather than an engineering role that integrates AI into a broader software product. Given the focus on training and evaluating generative AI, it aligns with the 'ML Specialist (Data Scientist)' profile, with a specific emphasis on generative AI tasks."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the core tasks involved in training and evaluating AI models. However, it lacks specific details about the technologies used or the depth of the software engineering experience required beyond the general mention. The profile assignment is strongly supported by the task descriptions, but the absence of technical specifics prevents a perfect score."
