                "justification": "Configuring 'AI Controllers' in tools like ComfyUI, which are used to guide generative AI output, aligns with the concept of controlling and directing AI models, similar to prompt engineering."

                "justification": "This involves creating and preparing specific 'elements' (like depth-maps, segmenters) that are used to control or influence the AI's output, which is a form of data preparation and feature engineering for AI models."

        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on tasks related to generative AI, specifically mentioning 'AI Controllers', 'ComfyUI', 'models and LoRas', and the generation of visual outputs. While there's an element of controlling AI output (akin to prompt engineering) and preparing data/elements for AI, the core emphasis is on managing and training models (LoRas) and ensuring the quality of AI-generated outputs. There are no explicit mentions of traditional software engineering tasks (like building APIs, microservices, CI/CD pipelines) or integrating AI into broader applications. Therefore, the role is best classified as a 'GenAI Specialist' due to its primary focus on the generative AI model lifecycle and output quality."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite specific about the tools and tasks involved in generative AI, particularly in the context of image generation and model fine-tuning (LoRas). However, it lacks detail on the broader software engineering aspects that might be present in a more integrated role. The confidence is high for the 'GenAI Specialist' profile due to the clear focus on generative AI tasks, but not a perfect 5 because the scope of 'controlling the AI' could be interpreted in slightly different ways, and there's no mention of broader software development practices."
