        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on traditional software engineering tasks (1.A.1), such as implementing games, writing high-performance code, and integrating APIs. While it mentions integrating AI and real-time data processing, the core responsibilities and emphasis are on the software development aspect. There are no specific tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). The role is about building software that *uses* AI, rather than developing or specializing in AI models themselves. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 5,
        "reasoning": "The job advertisement is very clear about its focus on game development and software engineering principles. It explicitly states that the priority is 'engineering excellence' over game design or visual aesthetics. The tasks listed are predominantly within the 'Software Development & Integration' category, with AI being an integrated component rather than the core focus of development. This clarity makes the analysis straightforward."
