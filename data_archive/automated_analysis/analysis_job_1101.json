These are core software engineering tasks (Macro-Category A). While it mentions integrating specific AI technologies like GPT-4 Vision and Amazon CodeWhisperer, the focus is on the integration and enhancement of these into existing systems and workflows, rather than deep model development or specialization in GenAI tasks like prompt engineering or fine-tuning. The role also includes providing support and guidance on utilizing these technologies, which leans towards enabling others within the business context. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile, where the primary focus is software engineering with AI as a component."
