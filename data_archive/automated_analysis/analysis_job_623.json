While it mentions 'AI solutions', the focus is on the engineering and operational aspects of these solutions rather than specific Generative AI technologies like LLMs or RAG. The role involves a significant amount of software engineering (Macro-Category A) for building robust ML systems, combined with core ML model development and research (Macro-Category B). There is no mention of GenAI-specific tasks, leading to the 'Core ML Engineer' classification."
