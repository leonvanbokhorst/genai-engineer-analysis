        "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on integrating AI capabilities into customer support systems and improving existing AI models through feedback and fine-tuning. While there's mention of AI model fine-tuning (1.B.1), the primary emphasis is on the application and integration of AI within a support context (1.A.1), rather than core AI model development or specialized GenAI tasks. The role is about enhancing an existing service with AI, making it an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer role."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to AI integration and improvement within a customer support context. The distinction between core AI development and applying AI to solve business problems is evident. However, the ad is relatively brief and lacks specific technical tool mentions, which slightly reduces the confidence in a perfect classification."
