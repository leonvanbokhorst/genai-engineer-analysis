The role involves a significant amount of model development (applying ML/AI, designing solutions, prototyping) and MLOps (managing lifecycle, deployment, monitoring, MLOps pipeline development). While there's a strong software engineering component in managing the lifecycle and MLOps, the core focus on LLMs and NLP, combined with the breadth of ML tasks, points towards a 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile. The tasks are balanced between Macro-Category A (MLOps) and Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization)."

However, it could be slightly more explicit about the specific GenAI techniques beyond 'NLP' and 'LLMs' to reach a score of 5. The balance between ML tasks and MLOps is well-defined."
