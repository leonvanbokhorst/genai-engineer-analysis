        "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on traditional software engineering tasks such as Spark programming, integrating with cloud ecosystems and third-party applications, and authoring reference architectures and demo applications (Macro-Category A). While it mentions 'data science and analytics' and the 'Databricks Data Intelligence Platform', there is no explicit mention of core AI/ML model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, RAG, or specific AI/ML frameworks. The role is primarily about demonstrating and integrating a platform that *enables* data science and analytics, rather than being a hands-on AI/ML model builder. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile, where the role leverages technical expertise to integrate and showcase a data platform that may have AI capabilities, but the core responsibilities are in software integration and pre-sales advisory."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is clear about the responsibilities being related to a data platform and pre-sales engineering, with a strong emphasis on integration and client interaction. However, it lacks specific details about AI/ML tasks or technologies, making it difficult to definitively classify it as an AI-specific role. The confidence is high for the assigned profile based on the absence of AI/ML-specific tasks, but not a perfect 5 due to the general nature of 'data science and analytics' which could sometimes involve AI/ML."
