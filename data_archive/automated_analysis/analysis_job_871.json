While it mentions experimenting with AI tools like GPT-4 Vision ('Model Development & Fine-Tuning' - 1.B.1), the emphasis is on integrating these into existing developmental processes and optimizing their implementation for scalable impact, rather than core AI model research or development. The role is about building software that leverages AI, rather than being a deep AI specialist."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering tasks with an AI component. The distinction between building AI-powered software and being an AI specialist is reasonably clear, though the mention of 'state-of-the-art AI tools' could imply deeper AI work. However, the overall framing leans towards integration and deployment within a software engineering context."
