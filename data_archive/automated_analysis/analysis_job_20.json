These are core software engineering tasks (Macro-Category A). While the team's mandate includes enabling ML decisioning and working on a GenAI project, the specific responsibilities listed for the role are predominantly focused on the software engineering aspects of the platform that supports these AI initiatives. There are no explicit tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or AI-specific data engineering (Macro-Category B). Therefore, the profile 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most appropriate, as the role builds and maintains software that directly supports AI/ML models."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering responsibilities, making the classification of tasks straightforward. The involvement in AI/ML is mentioned as a context for the platform, but the specific tasks are SE-focused. This leads to a high confidence in the task analysis and profile assignment, with a slight deduction as the exact balance of AI involvement is inferred from the SE tasks rather than explicitly detailed AI tasks."
