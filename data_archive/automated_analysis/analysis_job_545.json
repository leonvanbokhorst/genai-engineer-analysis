While it mentions 'data science and generative AI' and the need to 'make great strides' in these areas, the core responsibilities and the title 'Senior Software Developer' and 'Senior Integratie Engineer' indicate that the role is about building and integrating software systems that *may* incorporate AI/GenAI, rather than developing the AI models themselves. The tasks are predominantly from Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration), with a mention of AI/GenAI as a feature to be integrated or a domain to advance within the existing software platform."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the core software engineering responsibilities and technologies. However, the mention of 'generative AI' is somewhat vague and not elaborated with specific tasks related to GenAI model development or fine-tuning. The primary focus remains on software development and integration, making the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile a strong fit, but the limited detail on the AI aspect prevents a perfect score."
