It also mentions integrating AI models into Azure cloud solutions (1.A.1) and using Azure AI services to develop new models and solutions (1.B.1). While there is a mention of developing new models, the primary emphasis and the job title 'DevOps Engineer' point towards building and maintaining the infrastructure and pipelines for AI, rather than deep model development or specialization. The role is about enabling AI through robust engineering practices within a software context."
