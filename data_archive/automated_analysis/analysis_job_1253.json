        "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on implementing end-to-end ML pipelines and leading AI projects (Macro-Category A tasks), with a significant emphasis on client advisory, pre-sales, and relationship building (Business Understanding & Strategy). While it mentions developing ML solutions, it does not detail specific model development, fine-tuning, or GenAI-specific tasks (Macro-Category B). The role appears to be about integrating and managing ML solutions within client contexts rather than deep specialization in model creation or GenAI techniques."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to implementing ML pipelines and client interaction. However, it lacks specific details about the technologies used or the depth of ML/AI specialization required, making it slightly less definitive than a highly technical description. The profile assignment is strong based on the balance of tasks described."
