        "rationale": "The job advertisement exclusively details tasks related to traditional software development (designing, developing, testing, maintaining software) and collaboration within a software engineering context. It mentions C++ as the primary programming language and NX CAM as the software product. There is no indication of any AI, ML, or Generative AI specific responsibilities or technologies. This aligns perfectly with the definition of a `Software Engineer` profile, which focuses solely on Macro-Category A tasks without AI/ML integration."
