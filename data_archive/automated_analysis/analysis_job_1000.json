Phrases like 'help train AI models', 'engaging with these models as they learn to code', 'Crafting and answering questions related to computer science in order to help train AI models', and 'Evaluating and ranking code generated by AI models' all fall under Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization), specifically 'Model Development & Fine-Tuning' (1.B.1). There are no tasks mentioned that fall under Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering). While it mentions 'experienced software engineer', the core responsibilities are not about building software applications but about contributing to the AI model's learning process. Therefore, the profile is 'ML Specialist (Data Scientist)' due to the predominant focus on model-centric tasks, even though the models are generative."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the core tasks involved in training and evaluating AI models. However, it lacks specific technical details about the tools or platforms used, and the 'software engineer' framing could be slightly misleading if one expects traditional software development tasks. The primary focus is clearly on the AI model's learning process, which strongly points to a specialist role."
