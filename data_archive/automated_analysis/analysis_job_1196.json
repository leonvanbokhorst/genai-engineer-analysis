        "rationale": "The job ad focuses exclusively on DevOps and infrastructure tasks related to AI applications, such as CI/CD, deployment, monitoring, and ensuring scalability and security. While AI is mentioned as the domain, there are no tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. The mention of 'OOP' is a programming paradigm, not a specific AI task. Therefore, the role is classified as a 'Software Engineer' with a focus on the operational aspects of AI systems, rather than an AI/ML specialist or engineer."
