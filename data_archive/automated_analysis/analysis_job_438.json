The tasks are predominantly aligned with Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering), with a specific mention of AI-generated summaries fitting into 1.B.2. However, there's no deep dive into model development or specialized GenAI techniques. The profile assignment is quite clear based on the balance of tasks, but a slightly higher score could be achieved with more explicit detail on the AI components beyond summaries."
