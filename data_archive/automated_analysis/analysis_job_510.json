While it mentions Generative AI and LLM technologies, the focus is on integrating these into broader cloud solutions and data pipelines rather than deep model development or fine-tuning (Macro-Category B tasks). The role is about building and deploying AI-powered cloud infrastructure and applications, making it an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer role."

The tasks are well-defined, and the technologies mentioned are specific. The profile assignment is straightforward based on the balance of tasks. A slightly lower score is given because the 'Generative AI and LLM technologies' aspect is mentioned but not elaborated upon with specific model development tasks, leaning more towards integration and architecture."
