While it mentions 'experienced software engineer' and 'coding expertise', the core responsibilities are centered around interacting with and improving AI models rather than building software applications that integrate AI. There are no tasks related to software development & integration (Macro-Category A). Therefore, the profile is 'GenAI Specialist'."
