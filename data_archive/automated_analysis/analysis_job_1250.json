While AI is mentioned as a domain for applications ('(AI) applicaties', 'end-to-end AI-applicatieontwikkeling'), the core responsibilities and technologies listed are focused on building and integrating these applications rather than developing or fine-tuning AI models themselves. There is no mention of specific AI/ML model development, prompt engineering, RAG, or traditional ML tasks. The role is about building software that *uses* AI, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

The AI aspect is mentioned as the domain of the applications being built, but the core responsibilities are rooted in software engineering. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the term '(gen)AI toepassingen' could imply deeper AI involvement, though the specific tasks listed do not support this."
