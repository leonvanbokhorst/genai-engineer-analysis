        "rationale": "The job description heavily emphasizes traditional software development tasks using frameworks like Laravel and Vue. While AI is mentioned as a component of the applications being built ('(AI) applicaties', 'AI-applicatieontwikkeling'), there is no indication of core AI/ML model development, fine-tuning, or specialized GenAI tasks like prompt engineering or RAG. The tools listed are primarily web development frameworks and a low-code platform. This aligns with the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile, where the role is focused on building software that integrates AI features, rather than developing the AI models themselves."
