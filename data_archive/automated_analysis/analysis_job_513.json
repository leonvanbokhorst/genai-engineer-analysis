        "rationale": "The job ad focuses exclusively on tasks related to generative AI models, specifically mentioning ComfyUI, training custom models and LoRAs, and creating elements like depth-maps for AI control. There are no tasks related to traditional software engineering (Macro-Category A). Therefore, the role is classified as a GenAI Specialist."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite specific about the tasks involved in generative AI, particularly concerning model training and the use of specific tools like ComfyUI. However, it lacks explicit mentions of software development, integration, or MLOps, which would be needed to classify it as a Core GenAI Engineer. The absence of traditional software engineering tasks leads to the 'GenAI Specialist' profile. The confidence is high due to the clear focus on GenAI tasks, but not maximum because the scope is narrow and doesn't cover the full spectrum of a Core GenAI Engineer role."
