While it mentions integrating Generative AI solutions and collaborating with data science teams, the core responsibilities are centered around data infrastructure and processing. The role is about enabling AI/ML by providing high-quality data and integrated platforms, rather than developing or fine-tuning AI models themselves. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile, where the primary focus is on software engineering tasks that support or integrate AI capabilities."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines data engineering responsibilities and mentions the integration of Generative AI, making the classification relatively straightforward. However, the emphasis on 'Data Engineer' in the title and the detailed description of data pipeline and ETL tasks suggest the AI aspect is more of an integration/support function rather than a core AI development role. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the exact balance between data engineering and AI integration could be slightly more explicit."
