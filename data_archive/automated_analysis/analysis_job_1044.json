While it mentions the integration of generative AI solutions and lists specific LLMs (OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic) and NLP as a plus, these AI-specific tasks are presented as an addition to the core software engineering responsibilities, rather than the primary focus. The role is about building and enhancing the software platform that *uses* AI, rather than focusing solely on the AI models themselves. Therefore, it fits the profile of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines core software engineering responsibilities and mentions AI integration as a key development area. The technologies are also specified. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, because the AI-specific tasks are described as 'integrating' and a 'plus', suggesting they are not the sole or primary focus, leaving a slight ambiguity compared to a role explicitly focused on GenAI model development or specialization."
