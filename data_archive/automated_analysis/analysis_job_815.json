While it focuses on GenAI, it does not detail specific model development, fine-tuning, or prompt engineering tasks (1.B.x). The role is about building infrastructure and zero-to-one solutions for others to adopt, positioning it as a software engineering role that integrates GenAI capabilities rather than a deep specialization in GenAI model work itself. The emphasis on 'providing infrastructure for other teams to use' and 'building zero to one point solutions for others to adopt' strongly suggests the role is about enabling GenAI through software engineering."

It lacks specific details on the AI/ML model development side, making it lean towards a software engineering profile. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as there's always a slight possibility of unstated deep AI tasks."
