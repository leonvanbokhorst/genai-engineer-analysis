While it mentions working with data scientists and software professionals, the core responsibilities implied by 'DevOps Engineer' fall under Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration and Operations & MLOps). The ad does not detail specific GenAI model development or prompt engineering tasks (Macro-Category B), but rather the infrastructure and processes to support them. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer role, which focuses on building and maintaining software that supports AI/ML features."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is very brief and lacks specific details about the day-to-day tasks. While the title 'Azure GenAI DevOps Engineer' provides a strong indication, the description itself is high-level and focuses more on team structure and general goals rather than concrete responsibilities. This makes it difficult to definitively classify all tasks and assign a profile with high confidence."
