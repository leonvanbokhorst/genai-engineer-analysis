While it mentions integrating generative AI tech, the core focus remains on building and shipping software that *uses* AI, rather than deep model development or specialization in GenAI techniques like prompt engineering or RAG. The tasks are predominantly from Macro-Category A, with a clear emphasis on software development and integration, making it an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer role."
