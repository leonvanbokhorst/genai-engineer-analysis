While AI is mentioned as a tool or enabler for these tasks ('AI-driven systems', 'AI tools'), the core responsibilities do not involve developing or fine-tuning AI models themselves (Macro-Category B). The role focuses on integrating and operating AI within existing infrastructure to improve efficiency, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile which is predominantly Macro-Category A with AI integration."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the tasks as primarily operational and system-focused, using AI as a tool rather than the core subject of development. The distinction between this role and a core AI/ML engineering role is evident. However, the specific mention of 'scripting' as a skill is broad, and the exact nature of 'AI-driven systems' and 'AI tools' could be more detailed. Overall, the clarity is high, but not absolute."
