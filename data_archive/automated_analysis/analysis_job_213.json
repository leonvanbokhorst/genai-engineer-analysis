While it mentions leveraging 'generative AI' and specific AI-powered products (TeachTap, TeachTales, TimeBack, Athena), the focus is on building and integrating these AI features into the product rather than developing the AI models themselves. There are no explicit tasks related to model training, fine-tuning, or deep AI research. Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, where software engineering is the primary focus, augmented by the integration of AI capabilities."

The mention of AI is in the context of product features being built, not as the core focus of model development. The distinction between building software that *uses* AI versus building the AI itself is well-defined by the tasks listed."
