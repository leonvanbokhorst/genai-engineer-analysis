        "rationale": "The job ad emphasizes the design and development of ML/AI-based algorithms for patient monitoring and risk prediction. While it mentions 'generative AI' as a technology, the core tasks described (algorithm design, vital signs analysis, risk prediction) are more aligned with traditional ML. The role also includes a significant project management component (20-40%), which points to a balanced mix of technical (ML) and strategic/management responsibilities. It doesn't lean heavily into the specific tasks of prompt engineering or RAG, nor is it purely software integration without model development. Therefore, 'Core ML Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to algorithm development (ML/AI) and project management. The mention of 'generative AI' is present but not the sole focus of the technical tasks. The role seems to blend traditional ML with project leadership. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the emphasis on 'generative AI' could be interpreted in different ways without further context on the specific ML/AI solutions being developed."
