        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on tasks related to Generative AI, specifically prompt engineering (designing, refining prompts, using techniques like chain-of-thought) and fine-tuning LLMs. While there's a mention of analyzing project requirements and delivering solutions, which touches on business understanding, the core responsibilities are centered around the specialized skills of working with LLMs. There are no explicit mentions of traditional software engineering tasks (like building microservices, CI/CD pipelines, or general software development) or traditional ML tasks. Therefore, the 'GenAI Specialist' profile is the most appropriate fit."
