While 'ML Engineer' is in the title, the responsibilities listed do not include specific AI/ML model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. The focus is on the operational and engineering aspects of data and ML infrastructure, integrating them into broader services, rather than the AI model creation itself. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer who builds or maintains software that supports AI/ML, but isn't focused on the AI model development itself."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines infrastructure and operational tasks related to data and ML, with a strong emphasis on GCP and DevOps/MLOps practices. However, it lacks specific details about the AI/ML models themselves, making it slightly less definitive than a role explicitly detailing model building or GenAI tasks. The profile assignment is based on the strong evidence of software engineering and operational focus, with AI/ML being a component supported by this infrastructure."
