While it mentions the use of 'algorithms' for identifying healthcare providers and optimizing processes, it does not detail any specific Generative AI or traditional ML model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. The core responsibilities are firmly rooted in Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering), with only a minor mention of algorithmic application without specifying GenAI or ML model building. Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, as it builds software that leverages algorithms but doesn't focus on the development or specialization of AI models themselves."

However, the mention of 'algorithms' is vague and doesn't specify if it's traditional ML or GenAI, or if the role involves building these algorithms versus just integrating systems that use them. This slight ambiguity prevents a perfect score."
