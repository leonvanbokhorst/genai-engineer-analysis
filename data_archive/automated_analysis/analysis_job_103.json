        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on traditional backend software engineering tasks (1.A.1), such as developing scalable cloud-native systems, implementing backend systems, and ensuring integration. While it mentions 'modern LLM mission-critical applications' and 'LLM', these are described as the *applications* the platform caters to, rather than the core tasks of developing, fine-tuning, or engineering prompts for the LLMs themselves. The role is about building the infrastructure and backend systems that *support* LLM applications, not about the AI/ML model development or specialization itself. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile, where the primary focus is software engineering with an AI context."
    },
    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly defines the core responsibilities as backend software engineering. The mention of LLMs is in the context of the applications the platform will serve, not as a primary focus for the engineer's direct tasks. The lack of specific AI/ML tasks (like model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering) makes the classification straightforward. A score of 4 is given because while the role is clearly software engineering, the exact nature of the 'AI-Adjacent' aspect could be slightly more detailed, but the overall emphasis is strongly on the software engineering side."
