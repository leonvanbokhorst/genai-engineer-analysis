        "rationale": "The job ad heavily emphasizes tasks related to generative AI models, including exploring, adapting, and implementing them within a specific technical paradigm (confidential computing/MPC). While there are mentions of integrating feedback and contributing to AI tools/workflows (1.A.1), the core focus and majority of the tasks (1.B.1) are on the specialized development and adaptation of AI models themselves, rather than building broader software applications around them. There is no indication of traditional ML tasks. Therefore, the 'GenAI Specialist' profile is the most fitting."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite specific about the tasks involving generative AI and its adaptation to confidential computing. However, the mention of 'AI toolkit' and 'AI development workflows' could slightly lean towards software integration, but the primary emphasis remains on the AI model development and adaptation itself. The profile assignment is strong, but a perfect score is reserved for roles that might explicitly mention building end-user applications or more extensive software engineering practices."
