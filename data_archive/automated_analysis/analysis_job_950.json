While LLMs are mentioned, the core activities revolve around the performance engineering of these models and the underlying infrastructure (networking, GPUs, CPUs), rather than the development of generative AI applications or novel generative model architectures. The tasks are predominantly in Macro-Category B (Model Development & Fine-Tuning) with some in Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration for tools). The emphasis is on the 'how' of making these models performant, which is a specialization within ML engineering, rather than the 'what' of generative AI application building. It does not fit the 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile as the focus is not on prompt engineering, RAG, or building GenAI-powered features, but rather on the performance of the underlying models and infrastructure."

The distinction between traditional ML performance engineering and GenAI application development is clear, and the role leans heavily towards the former. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the term 'LLM training' could be interpreted by some as leaning towards GenAI, but the core tasks described are performance analysis and optimization, which are foundational ML engineering skills."
