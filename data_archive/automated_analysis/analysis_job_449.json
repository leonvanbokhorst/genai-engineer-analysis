While it mentions developing and deploying machine learning models and AI algorithms (1.B.1), this is presented as a feature to be integrated into the platform rather than the primary focus of the role. The technologies listed (AWS serverless, Python) are common in software engineering. The role's description as a 'Senior Software Engineer' for a 'SaaS Platform' further supports this, with AI/ML being a component of the platform rather than the sole or primary focus. Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."
