        "rationale": "The job advertisement focuses on Salesforce CPQ configuration and system setup, with a mention of using AI to improve efficiency. However, it does not describe tasks related to developing, fine-tuning, or specializing in AI/ML models themselves. The core responsibilities align with traditional software development and integration (Macro-Category A), with no significant tasks from Macro-Category B. Therefore, the 'Software Engineer' profile is the most appropriate."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is relatively clear about the focus on CPQ configuration and system setup. The mention of AI is framed as a tool for efficiency rather than a core area of expertise. The confidence is high, but not perfect, as the AI aspect is described metaphorically ('magic wand') rather than with specific technical details, leaving a slight ambiguity about the depth of AI involvement."
