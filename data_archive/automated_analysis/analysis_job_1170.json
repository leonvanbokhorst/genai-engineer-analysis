The core focus is on using AI tools to enhance software development and product delivery, rather than deep AI model research or development. The primary technologies mentioned (TypeScript, AWS Serverless) are also indicative of a software engineering role. Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, as it builds software that integrates AI capabilities."
