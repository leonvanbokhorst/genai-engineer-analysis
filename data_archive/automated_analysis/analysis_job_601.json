While it mentions 'Generative AI' and 'LLM', these are presented as areas to integrate or develop features within, rather than the core focus of model development or specialization. The role is about building the software that *uses* AI, not necessarily developing the AI models themselves. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

The mention of AI/GenAI is present but framed as integration into an existing platform rather than core AI model development. The profile assignment is strongly supported by the task descriptions. A slightly lower score is given because the depth of AI involvement isn't fully detailed, but the overall direction is clear."
