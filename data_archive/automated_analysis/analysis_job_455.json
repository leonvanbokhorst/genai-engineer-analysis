It also includes significant software engineering responsibilities like maintaining scalable code and integrating models into production (1.A.1), as well as MLOps aspects like monitoring service health (1.A.2). The role also requires understanding business requirements and translating them into LLM solutions (1.C.1) and collaborating with multidisciplinary teams (3.1). This balance of GenAI-specific tasks with strong software engineering and operational components, specifically centered around LLMs, points to the 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the core tasks involving LLM services and the need for software engineering and operational skills. However, it lacks specific mentions of technologies or frameworks, which would have made the classification of the 'GenAI' aspect more definitive. The tasks described are strongly indicative of a GenAI role, but the absence of specific tools prevents a perfect score."
