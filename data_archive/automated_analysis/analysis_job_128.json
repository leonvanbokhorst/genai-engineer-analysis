        "rationale": "The job advertisement consists solely of the title 'Senior Full Stack Developer'. It provides no information about specific tasks, technologies, or responsibilities related to Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning. Therefore, it is impossible to classify this role within the defined AI/ML profiles. While 'Full Stack Developer' implies software engineering tasks (Macro-Category A), there is no indication of AI/ML specialization (Macro-Category B). Consequently, the most appropriate classification is 'Not Relevant' as the ad does not contain sufficient information to determine its relevance to AI/ML roles as defined by the coding book."

        "reasoning": "The job advertisement is extremely brief, containing only a title. This lack of detail makes it impossible to perform a meaningful analysis of job tasks, technologies, or soft skills, and therefore impossible to confidently assign an AI/ML profile."
