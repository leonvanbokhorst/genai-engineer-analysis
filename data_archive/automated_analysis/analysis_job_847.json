        "assigned_profile": "Core GenAI Engineer",
        "rationale": "The job ad emphasizes owning the technical strategy and vision for platforms including Generative AI, alongside other ML domains like Search Ranking and Recommendations. It requires significant hands-on ML engineering experience, technical leadership, and the ability to define architecture and long-term direction. While it mentions Generative AI, it also covers traditional ML areas and a strong software engineering foundation (architecture, distributed systems, cloud). The role is balanced between defining strategy for AI capabilities (B) and ensuring their integration and scalability within the broader platform (A), with a clear focus on GenAI as a key area. The emphasis on owning strategy and vision for GenAI capabilities, coupled with the need for strong ML engineering and software architecture, points to a Core GenAI Engineer profile."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 5,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is very detailed, clearly outlining responsibilities, required qualifications, and the strategic importance of ML/AI, including Generative AI. The distinction between core ML and GenAI is implicitly handled by the breadth of domains mentioned, with GenAI being a significant component. The role's senior nature and focus on strategy and architecture make the classification straightforward."
