        "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on traditional software engineering tasks such as configuring and maintaining network functions, implementing and managing AI-driven systems, and troubleshooting. While AI is mentioned as a tool to enhance these processes, the core responsibilities are rooted in system operations and integration (Macro-Category A). There are no explicit tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, where AI is used to augment existing software engineering and operational tasks."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the tasks and responsibilities, emphasizing traditional system configuration and operational improvements using AI as a tool. It explicitly states it's not a traditional engineering or support role but combines technical work with AI tools. The distinction between using AI tools and developing AI models is clear. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as some phrases could be interpreted slightly differently, but the overall emphasis on system integration and operations is strong."
