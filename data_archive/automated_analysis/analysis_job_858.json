While generative AI is mentioned as an area for exploration, it is not presented as a core responsibility or a primary focus of the role. The tasks and skills described align predominantly with Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering), with no significant tasks falling into Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization). Therefore, the 'Software Engineer' profile is the most appropriate."

The mention of generative AI is contextualized as an area for exploration rather than a primary duty."
