This distribution indicates a primary focus on software engineering. The role involves building a core application that integrates Generative AI models and also developing ML algorithms. Given that the majority of tasks fall under software development and integration (1.A.1), and the role integrates AI/ML features into a product (the Syntho Engine Core Application), the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile is the most fitting. The specific mention of 'Generative AI models' and 'ML algorithms' highlights the AI aspect, but the emphasis on building the 'scalable Syntho Engine Core Application' and 'software solution' anchors it firmly in software engineering."
