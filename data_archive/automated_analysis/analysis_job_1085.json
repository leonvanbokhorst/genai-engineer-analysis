        "rationale": "The job ad heavily emphasizes traditional software engineering tasks such as designing, developing, testing, and maintaining backend infrastructure, integrating models into enterprise systems, and implementing data security. While AI is mentioned as the domain, the core responsibilities are focused on the software engineering aspects of building and integrating AI solutions rather than the development or fine-tuning of AI models themselves. There are no specific mentions of Generative AI tasks like prompt engineering or RAG, nor traditional ML tasks like model training or algorithm selection. Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."
