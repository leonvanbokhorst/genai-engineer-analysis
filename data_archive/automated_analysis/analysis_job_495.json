While it deals with privacy compliance and uses concepts like 'privacy by design' and 'privacy risk estimation', it does not mention the development, fine-tuning, or specific application of AI/ML models (Macro-Category B). The role is about building software to support and automate compliance processes, rather than building AI models themselves. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile, where software engineering is the primary focus, and AI/ML concepts are integrated into the product or process being built."
