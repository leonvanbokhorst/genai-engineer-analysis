While it mentions working with 'GenAI technologies' and 'machine learning', these appear to be integrated into the broader software development context of building prototypes for customer challenges, rather than being the primary focus of model development or specialization. The role is about building software solutions that *use* these technologies, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

The mention of 'GenAI technologies' is present but not detailed enough to suggest a primary focus on GenAI specialization. The emphasis on prototyping and customer-facing solutions leans towards software development. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, due to the slight ambiguity in the depth of AI/ML involvement."
