While it mentions leveraging AI and generative AI, the focus is on using AI tools to enhance the software engineering process and integrate AI-driven solutions into existing products, rather than developing AI models themselves. There are no explicit tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. The technologies mentioned (AWS, serverless) are also typical for software engineering. Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, where AI is a tool and a component integrated into software, but not the primary focus of model creation or deep specialization."
