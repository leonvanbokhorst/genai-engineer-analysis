While 'OpenAI & LLM' are mentioned as technologies, there are no specific tasks described that involve deep engagement with Generative AI models like prompt engineering, fine-tuning, or RAG development. The role is about building and maintaining software, which happens to use or integrate AI/ML features, rather than specializing in the AI/ML aspects themselves. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

The mention of 'OpenAI & LLM' is present but not elaborated with specific tasks, making the AI/ML aspect secondary and less defined. This leads to a high, but not perfect, confidence score as the extent of AI integration is not fully detailed."
