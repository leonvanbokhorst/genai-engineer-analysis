While the role explicitly mentions working with 'GenAI technologies' and practicing disciplines like 'machine learning' and 'data science', these are presented as part of a broad, generalist skillset applied to customer challenges. The emphasis remains on building well-architected software and prototypes, making the role predominantly Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering) with AI/ML/GenAI as integrated components or areas of application. This fits the definition of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

However, it's not extremely specific about the depth of GenAI involvement beyond 'working with' it and mentioning it as a technology area. It could be interpreted slightly differently depending on how much weight is given to 'GenAI technologies' vs. the explicit software development tasks."
