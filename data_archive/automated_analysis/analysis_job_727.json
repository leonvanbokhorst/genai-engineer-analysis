The CODING_BOOK.md defines profiles based on the presence and nature of tasks within Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering) and Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization). Without any such details, it is impossible to determine if the role involves AI/ML tasks or even core software engineering. Therefore, it cannot be classified into any of the AI/ML-specific profiles. The 'Not Relevant' profile is the most appropriate classification as the ad does not provide sufficient information to align with any of the defined categories."
