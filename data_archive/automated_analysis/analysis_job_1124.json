        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on tasks related to improving and fine-tuning AI models (1.B.1, 1.B.2) and integrating AI capabilities into customer support (1.A.1). While there's an integration aspect, the core responsibilities revolve around the AI's performance and improvement rather than building a broader software product around it. There are no mentions of traditional software engineering tasks like building microservices or extensive backend development. The emphasis on 'improving the AI system' and 'AI model fine-tuning sessions' points towards a specialization in GenAI rather than a balanced engineering role."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to AI improvement and fine-tuning, which strongly suggests a GenAI Specialist profile. However, the 'Application Support Engineer' title and the mention of 'integrating AI capabilities' could imply some software engineering overlap, making it not entirely unambiguous. The salary and title might also suggest a more junior or support-oriented role than a pure specialist, but the tasks themselves are specialized."
