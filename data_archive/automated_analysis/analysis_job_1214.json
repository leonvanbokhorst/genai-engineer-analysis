It explicitly mentions specializations in Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Generative AI (LLM), indicating a strong focus on AI model development (Macro-Category B). Simultaneously, it lists core software engineering tasks like designing, developing, and maintaining AI systems, along with MLOps, DevOps, CI/CD, and programming skills (Macro-Category A). The inclusion of Generative AI (LLM) as a specialization, alongside traditional ML areas, and the emphasis on both development and operational aspects, points towards a balanced role that heavily involves GenAI. Therefore, 'Core GenAI Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines a training program and the expected skills upon completion. It explicitly mentions both core software engineering practices (MLOps, DevOps, CI/CD) and AI specializations (Deep Learning, Generative AI). The primary focus on becoming an 'AI Engineer' with a clear path to specialization suggests a well-defined role. However, the ad is a description of a training program rather than a direct job description for an ongoing role, which slightly reduces the confidence in predicting the exact day-to-day tasks post-training."
