While AI is mentioned as a core component, the tasks described are primarily about operational efficiency, system configuration, and incident management using these tools, rather than developing or fine-tuning AI models themselves ('Macro-Category B' tasks). The role is about integrating and managing AI-driven systems within an operational context, making it an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer role."

However, it lacks specific details about the AI technologies or models being used, and the 'scripting' skill is broad. The distinction between 'AI-driven systems' and 'AI tools' is also somewhat vague, preventing a perfect score."
