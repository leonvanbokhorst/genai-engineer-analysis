While it mentions 'AI messaging systems' and the 'AI industry', there are no specific tasks or requirements related to developing, fine-tuning, or engineering prompts for Generative AI models or traditional ML models. The role is primarily about building and maintaining the infrastructure that might support AI, rather than building the AI itself. Therefore, it fits the 'Software Engineer' profile."
