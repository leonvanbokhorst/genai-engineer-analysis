While it mentions 'GenAI technology' and 'GenAI components', the core responsibilities and required skills (adaptability, problem-solving, learning new technologies, leading delivery) are firmly rooted in software engineering (Macro-Category A). There are no specific tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). The role is about delivering software that *uses* GenAI, rather than specializing in the GenAI models themselves. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job advertisement is very clear about the primary focus being on software delivery and engineering leadership. While GenAI is mentioned as the domain, the responsibilities and required skills are consistently aligned with traditional software engineering practices. The distinction between building software *with* AI and building AI models is clear, and this role falls into the former. There is no ambiguity in the core responsibilities."
