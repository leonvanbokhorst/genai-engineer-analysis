The role is described as a 'Full-stack Software Engineer' that will 'build new AI centric products', indicating that the core function is software engineering with AI as a component, rather than deep AI research or model building. The presence of 'Some knowledge and experience of AI / ML software engineering' further supports this, suggesting AI is an augmentation to the software engineering role."
