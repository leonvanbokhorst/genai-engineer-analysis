While it mentions 'generative AI' and 'AI Engineer', the core responsibilities are focused on applying and integrating these technologies within customer modernization projects, rather than developing or fine-tuning AI models themselves (which would fall under Macro-Category B). The role is about using AI tools to facilitate software engineering tasks and customer engagements, making it an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite detailed regarding the software engineering aspects of the role, including the full application lifecycle and project execution. However, the specific AI/ML tasks are described more in terms of 'exploring possibilities' and 'applying tools' rather than deep model development. The mention of 'generative AI' is present but not the primary focus of the detailed responsibilities. This makes the classification as 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' strong, but not a perfect 5 due to the slight ambiguity in the depth of AI involvement."
