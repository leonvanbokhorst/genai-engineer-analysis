While AI is mentioned as a core component, the tasks described are primarily about integrating and managing these AI-driven systems within existing operational frameworks, rather than developing novel AI models or specializing in GenAI techniques like prompt engineering or RAG. The role emphasizes scripting, system configuration, and troubleshooting, which are core software engineering skills. Therefore, it fits the profile of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer who builds or maintains software that directly uses AI features."

The distinction between this role and traditional engineering or support is also made clear. However, the specific AI technologies or models are not detailed, and the term 'AI tools' is broad, preventing a perfect score. The focus is clearly on the 'application' and 'support' of AI systems rather than deep AI model development."
