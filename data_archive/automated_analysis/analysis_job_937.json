        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on creating and maintaining backend systems and an end-to-end content automation platform. While it mentions 'generative AI' and 'rule-based generative AI', the core responsibilities are centered around software development and integration (Macro-Category A). The role is about building the platform that *uses* generative AI, rather than specializing in the development or fine-tuning of the AI models themselves (Macro-Category B). Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the primary responsibilities as backend software development and system operation. The mention of 'generative AI' is in the context of what the platform drives, not as a core AI development task. The role is clearly software-centric, making the profile assignment straightforward. However, the ad could be more explicit about the specific AI technologies or libraries involved to achieve a perfect score."
