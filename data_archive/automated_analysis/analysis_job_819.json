        "rationale": "The job title 'Software Engineer II, Frontend, ML Platform' indicates a role primarily focused on software development (Macro-Category A), specifically frontend. The 'ML Platform' context suggests the software being built is part of or interacts with a machine learning infrastructure. This aligns with the AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile, which describes roles that build or maintain software integrating AI/ML features or supporting AI/ML systems, without necessarily performing the core ML model development tasks."
