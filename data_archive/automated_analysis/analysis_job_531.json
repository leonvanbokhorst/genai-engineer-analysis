As such, it does not contain any information that can be mapped to the job task categories defined in the CODING_BOOK.md, making it impossible to assign a relevant profile based on the required analysis of job tasks. The 'Not Relevant' profile is the most appropriate due to the complete absence of descriptive content about the role's duties."

        "reasoning": "The job advertisement provided is extremely minimal, consisting only of a job title ('Frontend & WordPress Developer') and navigation elements. It lacks any descriptive text regarding job responsibilities, tasks, or required skills. This absence of information prevents any meaningful analysis against the CODING_BOOK.md categories, leading to a very low confidence score."
