While it involves Generative AI, the focus is on enabling data teams and integrating solutions into the organization's ecosystem, rather than deep model development or fine-tuning (Macro-Category B). The role acts as a technical focal point and leader for the GenAI platform, supporting others in building their solutions, which aligns with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

The tasks are well-defined, and the role's position within the organization's data ecosystem is clear. However, it doesn't explicitly detail deep model development or fine-tuning, making the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile the most fitting, but not definitively ruling out a slight overlap with 'Core GenAI Engineer' if the 'foundational components' or 'operations capabilities' imply more than just infrastructure."
