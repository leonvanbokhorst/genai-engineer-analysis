While the company's product (DeepL Write) is AI-powered, the role's responsibilities are centered on building and maintaining the software infrastructure that supports AI functionality, rather than developing or fine-tuning AI models themselves. There is no mention of tasks related to Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization)."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly defines the role as a backend engineer with a focus on C# and service development. It mentions collaboration with research teams for AI functionality integration, which is typical for an AI-adjacent role. The absence of specific AI/ML model development tasks or frameworks in the core responsibilities makes the profile assignment straightforward. The clarity on the technical stack (C#) and the nature of the tasks (backend services) supports a high confidence score."
