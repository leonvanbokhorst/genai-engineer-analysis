While it mentions using generative AI for 'AI-Enhanced Project Delivery' and 'AI-driven professional services engagements', the core responsibilities and the explicit exclusion of 'Coding or programming' suggest that the role is about integrating AI into existing consulting services and platforms rather than developing AI models themselves. The focus is on applying AI to enhance project delivery and client service, aligning with the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile, which is predominantly Macro-Category A with AI integration."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the nature of the work, emphasizing consulting and system integration over core AI development or traditional software engineering coding. The explicit mention of 'What you will NOT be doing' including 'Coding or programming' is a strong indicator. However, the term 'Implementation Engineer' can sometimes imply deeper technical involvement, leading to a slightly less than perfect confidence score."
