        "rationale": "The job description heavily emphasizes core software engineering tasks such as designing, building, and maintaining data pipelines, implementing infrastructure as code, CI/CD, containerization, and managing deployments. While it mentions supporting the development and deployment of machine learning models and analytical software, it does not detail tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. The focus is on the engineering and operational aspects of making ML/analytics tools functional and deployable, rather than the AI model creation itself. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines a set of responsibilities that fall primarily under software engineering and MLOps. There is no ambiguity regarding the core tasks. However, the absence of specific AI/ML model development tasks prevents a higher score, as it's not a 'Core ML Engineer' or 'Specialist' role. The confidence is high that it's an adjacent software engineering role."
