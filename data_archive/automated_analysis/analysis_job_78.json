While it doesn't explicitly mention GenAI frameworks like LangChain or RAG, the focus on LLMs and the core tasks of model development and infrastructure optimization for these models strongly indicate a GenAI focus. The role involves both model-centric tasks (Macro-Category B) and infrastructure/development tasks (Macro-Category A), suggesting a balanced mix. Therefore, 'Core GenAI Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly focuses on Large Language Models (LLMs) and outlines relevant tasks. However, it lacks specific mentions of technologies or frameworks that would further solidify the 'GenAI' aspect beyond the LLM focus. The responsibilities are well-defined within the ML/AI domain, but the absence of explicit GenAI tools or techniques (like RAG, prompt engineering) prevents a perfect score."
