Phrases like 'help train AI models', 'train generative artificial intelligence models', and 'Crafting and answering questions related to computer science in order to help train AI models' clearly fall under Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization). While the role requires coding expertise, the core responsibilities are centered around the AI model's learning and evaluation process, rather than software development or integration into a larger application. There are no tasks mentioned that fall under Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering). Therefore, the profile leans towards a specialist role focused on the AI model itself."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the core tasks related to AI model training and evaluation. However, it lacks specific details about the technologies used or the broader software engineering context, which prevents a perfect score. The profile assignment is strongly supported by the task descriptions."
