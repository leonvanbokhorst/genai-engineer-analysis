The mention of 'Werken met nieuwe technologieën zoals AI (LLM)' indicates the integration of AI/LLM capabilities into the backend software. This aligns with the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile, which describes roles that build or maintain software that directly uses AI/ML models as a core part of its functionality, resulting in an AI-powered feature or system. There are no tasks specified that belong to Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization)."
