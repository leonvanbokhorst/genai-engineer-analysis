        "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on traditional full-stack software development tasks (backend with Node.js/Python, frontend with Vue.js) and integrating AI functionalities. While it mentions experimenting with AI tools like Tensorflow and Huggingface Transformers, the core responsibility is building and expanding an AI-tool, rather than deep model development or specialization in GenAI concepts like RAG or prompt engineering. The role is primarily software engineering with an AI component, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the core responsibilities being full-stack development. The mention of AI tools is present but not the sole focus. The profile assignment is straightforward based on the balance of tasks. A slightly lower score is given because 'experimenteren met AI' could be interpreted in various ways, but the overall emphasis on full-stack development makes the classification reasonably certain."
