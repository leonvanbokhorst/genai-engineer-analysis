        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on 'AI-centric solutions' and 'AI-driven Web / Mobile Applications and Tools', indicating that the core responsibility is software development and integration (Macro-Category A). While AI is mentioned, the tasks described are primarily about building and maintaining applications that *use* AI, rather than developing or specializing in AI models themselves (Macro-Category B). The role involves collaboration, system maintenance, and staying updated on AI trends, all within the context of software engineering. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is relatively clear about the software development focus with an AI component. However, it lacks specific details about the AI technologies or models involved, and the 'AI-centric' and 'AI-driven' descriptions are broad. The tasks are more aligned with integrating AI into existing software paradigms rather than deep AI/ML work. The confidence is high but not perfect due to the lack of specificity regarding the AI aspects."
