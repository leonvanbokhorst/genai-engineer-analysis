        "rationale": "The role focuses on integrating AI capabilities into customer resolution processes and improving AI systems through feedback and fine-tuning. While there's mention of AI model fine-tuning (1.B.1), the primary emphasis is on applying human expertise to areas where AI falls short and improving the AI system itself, which aligns with integrating AI into existing workflows and improving them (1.A.1). The role is not about building AI models from scratch or deep research but rather about supporting and enhancing AI-driven customer support. Therefore, it's classified as AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to AI integration and improvement within a customer support context. While it mentions 'AI model fine-tuning', the overall framing suggests a role that supports and enhances existing AI systems rather than developing core AI models. The 'What you will NOT be doing' section and the emphasis on self-unblocking provide good context for the required skills. The confidence is high, but not perfect, as the term 'fine-tuning' could imply deeper ML involvement than the rest of the description suggests."
