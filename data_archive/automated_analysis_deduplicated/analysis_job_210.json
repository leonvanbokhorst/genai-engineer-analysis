        "rationale": "The job description emphasizes designing, implementing, and maintaining AI-powered educational products. The core responsibilities fall under Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration, Operations & MLOps), focusing on building and scaling features, technical strategy, and product stability. While AI is central to the product's functionality (e.g., TeachTap, TeachTales), the tasks described do not involve core AI model development, fine-tuning, or specialized GenAI techniques (Macro-Category B). Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, where AI is a feature integrated into a software product."
