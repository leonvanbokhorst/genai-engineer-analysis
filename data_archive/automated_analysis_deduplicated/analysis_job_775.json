While there's a strong software engineering component (1.A.1, 1.A.2), the focus on LLMs and GenAI, coupled with the need for model development tasks, points towards a balanced role. The explicit mention of 'Generative AI driven products and tools' and 'LLMs' clearly places it within the GenAI domain. The 'Staff' level also implies leadership and strategic input, fitting the 'Core' designation."

The definition of a 'Staff Engineer' at Mozilla also provides context for the expected responsibilities, which align well with the identified tasks. There is no ambiguity regarding the core technologies or responsibilities."
