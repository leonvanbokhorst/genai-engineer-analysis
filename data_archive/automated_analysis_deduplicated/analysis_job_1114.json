        "rationale": "The job description primarily focuses on integrating AI capabilities into existing customer resolution systems and improving AI models through feedback and fine-tuning. While there are elements of AI model fine-tuning (1.B.1), the core responsibility is to improve the AI system and integrate AI capabilities to deliver customer support, which aligns with Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration). The role is about supporting and enhancing an AI-augmented system rather than developing novel AI models from scratch or specializing solely in GenAI tasks. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."
    },
    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines tasks related to improving AI systems and integrating AI capabilities into customer support. While the tasks lean towards AI integration and improvement, the specific mention of 'AI model fine-tuning sessions' could suggest a slightly deeper involvement in AI specialization. However, the overall context points more towards supporting and enhancing an existing AI-augmented system. The confidence is high, but not perfect, due to the slight ambiguity between enhancing AI systems (AI-Adjacent) and direct model work (Specialist/Engineer)."
