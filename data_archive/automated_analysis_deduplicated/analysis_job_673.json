While it mentions AI and specific GenAI technologies like RAG and GPT-4, these are presented as components to be integrated into existing product lines rather than the primary focus of model development or deep AI research. The role is about building software that *uses* AI, not necessarily about building the AI models themselves. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile, which is predominantly Macro-Category A with AI integration."
