While AI is mentioned ('(AI) applicaties', 'complexe AI-concepten'), there are no specific tasks related to building, training, fine-tuning, or optimizing AI models themselves. The role focuses on integrating AI concepts into applications using tools like Flutterflow, Firebase, and Supabase. This aligns with the AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile, which is characterized by predominantly Macro-Category A tasks that integrate AI/ML features into a product."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is clear about the core responsibilities being application development using specific tools. The mention of AI is present but not detailed in terms of specific AI tasks. The profile assignment is straightforward based on the dominance of software engineering tasks. A perfect score might require more explicit detail on how AI is integrated or what specific AI models/concepts are being used, but the current information is sufficient for a high confidence assessment."
