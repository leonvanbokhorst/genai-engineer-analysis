While it mentions 'AI-first approach' and leveraging 'generative AI', the tasks described are primarily about building and maintaining the software product that incorporates these AI features, rather than developing or specializing in the AI models themselves. There is no mention of model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or specific AI frameworks. Therefore, the role is classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, focusing on Macro-Category A tasks."
