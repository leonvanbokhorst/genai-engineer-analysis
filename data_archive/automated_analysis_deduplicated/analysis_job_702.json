While AI is mentioned as a tool, the core tasks revolve around traditional software engineering and operational tasks (configuring network functions, managing incidents, building monitoring tools) rather than developing or fine-tuning AI models themselves. The role integrates AI as a means to improve existing processes, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

However, it does not delve into specific AI model development or deep GenAI specialization, making the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile a strong fit. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the description could be more explicit about the *type* of AI tools used, though the context strongly suggests operational automation rather than model creation."
