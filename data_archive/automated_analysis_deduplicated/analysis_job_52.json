There are no core software engineering tasks (Macro-Category A) mentioned, nor are there tasks related to traditional ML. This focus on GenAI-specific tasks and strategic application, without core software engineering responsibilities, best fits the GenAI Specialist profile."

        "reasoning": "The job advertisement clearly outlines the focus on prompt engineering and suggesting AI solutions, which are specific GenAI tasks. The soft skills are also well-defined. However, the absence of specific technology mentions and the dual 'copywriter/prompt engineer' title, while clarified by the description, prevent a perfect score."
