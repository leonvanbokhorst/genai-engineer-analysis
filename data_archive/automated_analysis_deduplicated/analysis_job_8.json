        "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on traditional software engineering tasks such as designing and developing components, integrating features into existing systems (microservices APIs), and contributing to technical strategy. While it explicitly mentions integrating 'generative AI capabilities' and 'in-house generative AI models,' it does not detail tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or specific GenAI frameworks. This indicates that the role is primarily a software engineering position that leverages AI as a feature within the product, rather than a role focused on the AI model development itself. This aligns with the definition of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."
