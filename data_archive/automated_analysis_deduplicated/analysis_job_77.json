        "rationale": "The job advertisement heavily emphasizes tasks related to the core development and optimization of Large Language Models (LLMs), including foundational model training, data collection, inference optimization, model alignment, and evaluation. While there's mention of infrastructure design (1.A.2), the primary focus and the majority of tasks fall under GenAI Specialization (1.B.1, 1.B.3). There are no explicit mentions of integrating these models into broader software applications (1.A.1) or traditional ML tasks. Therefore, the role is best classified as a GenAI Specialist."
