While it mentions 'emerging technologies such as Generative AI' as an opportunity, the core responsibilities and examples provided (optimizing electricity grid, cancer research, insurance company model deployment) are rooted in traditional ML applications. The role also includes significant software engineering and MLOps components ('building data pipelines', 'productionizing models', 'MLOps principles', 'CI/CD', 'automation'), indicating a balanced mix of Macro-Category A and B tasks. However, the specialization is clearly in traditional ML rather than GenAI."

The mention of Generative AI is present but not as a primary focus. The confidence is high, but not perfect, as the emphasis on GenAI is more of an opportunity than a core requirement, making the distinction between a 'Core ML Engineer' and a 'Core GenAI Engineer' slightly less definitive than it could be if GenAI tasks were more prominent."
