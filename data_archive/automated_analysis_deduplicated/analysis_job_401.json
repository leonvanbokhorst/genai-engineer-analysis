        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on traditional software engineering tasks such as translating business demands into technical solutions, working with engineering frameworks, implementation, and production. While it mentions AI fields like NLP, time series modeling, and image recognition, these are presented as areas of project diversity rather than core responsibilities for model development or GenAI specialization. The role emphasizes data architecture and engineering within a broader digital transformation context. There is no mention of specific GenAI tasks like prompt engineering, RAG, or fine-tuning LLMs. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer who integrates AI/ML features into a product or system."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering and business-translation responsibilities. However, the specific AI/ML tasks are mentioned broadly ('natural language processing, time series modelling and image recognition') without detailing the depth of involvement or specific technologies. This leaves a slight ambiguity regarding the precise nature of the AI integration, preventing a perfect score."
