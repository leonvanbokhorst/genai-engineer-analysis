The core task described is the integration and responsible use of Generative AI ('Generative AI binnen NS te introduceren', 'veilig en verantwoord kunnen gebruiken'). While it mentions Generative AI, it doesn't detail specific model development, fine-tuning, or prompt engineering tasks. The role appears to be about building or integrating AI features into the existing environment, fitting the description of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, which is predominantly Macro-Category A with AI integration."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is relatively clear about the role's focus on introducing and integrating Generative AI within a company context. It highlights collaboration and responsible usage. However, it lacks specific technical details about the AI models or frameworks to be used, or the depth of AI-specific tasks, making it slightly less definitive than a highly detailed ad. The profile assignment is based on the emphasis on integration rather than deep AI model work."
