        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on maintaining, improving, and integrating existing conversational AI solutions (Chatbot Anna, IVR, Advisor Assist) and migrating to new platforms like MS Copilot. While it mentions evaluating LLM prompts and classification algorithms, the core emphasis is on the software engineering aspects of automating workflows, ensuring reliability, security, and integrating these AI components into broader systems. The tasks are predominantly from Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration), with some specific AI tasks (1.B.1, 1.B.2, 1.B.3) that support the integration and improvement of the AI-powered products. There is no indication of core model development or deep research into generative models themselves, nor a focus on traditional ML tasks. Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to maintaining and improving AI-powered systems and workflows, with specific mentions of LLMs and data pipelines. The tasks lean towards integration and automation within an existing product context. The profile assignment is quite clear, but a perfect score is not given as some of the AI-specific tasks are described at a high level, and the exact balance between pure software engineering and AI specialization could be slightly more explicit."
