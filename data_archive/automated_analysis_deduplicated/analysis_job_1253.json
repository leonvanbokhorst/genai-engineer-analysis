It also includes software development for evaluation tools (1.A.1) and maintaining production systems (1.A.2). The emphasis is on traditional ML model improvement and supporting infrastructure rather than specific Generative AI tasks like prompt engineering or RAG. Therefore, it aligns best with a 'Core ML Engineer' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the tasks involved, specifically mentioning fine-tuning models and data pipelines, which are core ML activities. The inclusion of software development and production system maintenance also points towards a balanced role. However, it doesn't explicitly mention 'Generative AI' or specific LLM technologies, making it lean towards traditional ML, but the 'AI/ML' phrasing could be interpreted broadly. The confidence is high due to the clarity of the tasks, but not maximum because the specific AI domain (GenAI vs. traditional ML) isn't explicitly delineated beyond the tasks themselves."
