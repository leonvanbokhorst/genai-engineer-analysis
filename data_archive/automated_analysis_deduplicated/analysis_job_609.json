While it mentions 'Generative AI' and 'Deep Learning' in the associated company tags, the core responsibilities described are about developing algorithms and automating design, which aligns more with traditional ML engineering tasks rather than specific GenAI applications like LLMs or RAG. The role is described as 'Data Science Software Engineer', indicating a blend of software engineering (Macro-Category A) and ML/algorithm development (Macro-Category B). Given the emphasis on developing algorithms and products for automation, and the mention of traditional ML/DL concepts, the 'Core ML Engineer' profile is the most fitting. There's no explicit mention of LLMs, prompt engineering, or RAG systems."

However, the specific mention of 'Generative AI' and 'Deep Learning' in the associated tags, contrasted with the core description of developing algorithms for automation, creates a slight ambiguity. The primary focus seems to be on traditional ML/automation rather than cutting-edge GenAI applications. The confidence is high but not perfect due to this slight divergence between the descriptive text and the associated tags."
