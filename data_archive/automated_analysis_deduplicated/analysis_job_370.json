It also includes core software engineering responsibilities (1.A.1) like designing, deploying, and maintaining data platforms, integrating Generative AI solutions, and understanding security tools. While it mentions Generative AI and Azure OpenAI Services, the primary emphasis is on the data infrastructure and integration aspects rather than deep model development or GenAI specialization. The role is about building and maintaining the data foundation that supports AI, and integrating AI solutions into existing systems, rather than being a specialist in AI model creation or GenAI application development. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."
