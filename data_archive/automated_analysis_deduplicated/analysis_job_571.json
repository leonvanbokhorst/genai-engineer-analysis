It requires research and development of solutions for data generation (1.B.1), data processing for datasets (1.B.3), and designing/running experiments for model training (1.B.1). Crucially, it also emphasizes delivering 'production-ready solutions for deployment' and 'engineering developments necessary to ship new AI models into product' (1.A.1), indicating a strong software engineering component. The balance between core AI model development and the engineering required to deploy these models, coupled with the explicit focus on Generative AI (text-to-video, foundational models for humans), aligns best with the 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile."
