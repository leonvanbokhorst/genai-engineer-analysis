        "rationale": "The job advertisement focuses heavily on software development and integration tasks within the Salesforce ecosystem, including automating configurations and managing CI/CD pipelines. While it mentions 'AI-driven solutions', the core responsibilities and technologies (Salesforce, CPQ) are rooted in traditional software engineering. The AI aspect appears to be a feature integrated into the existing software rather than the primary focus of model development or specialization. Therefore, the role is classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering tasks and mentions AI as a means to achieve automation. However, it lacks specific details about the AI technologies or models used, making it difficult to assess the depth of AI involvement. The primary focus remains on Salesforce development and CI/CD."
