While there's a mention of 'AI model fine-tuning sessions' (Macro-Category B), the core responsibility is supporting customer resolutions by improving the AI, rather than developing AI models from scratch or specializing deeply in GenAI techniques. The role is about using and enhancing AI within a support function, making it AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to AI integration and improvement within a customer support context. The distinction between core AI development and using AI in an application is evident. However, the ad is concise, and some aspects of 'fine-tuning' could be interpreted with varying degrees of depth, leading to a slightly less than perfect confidence score."
