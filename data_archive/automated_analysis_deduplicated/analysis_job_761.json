The tasks described fall primarily under 'Software Development & Integration' (Macro-Category A), such as leading collaborations, driving development of processes and automation, and supporting integration of workflows and tools. While AI and GenAI are mentioned as areas of focus, the core responsibilities are about integrating these technologies into production processes and optimizing workflows, rather than developing AI models themselves. There is no mention of specific AI model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, as it involves building and maintaining software/processes that utilize AI as a core component."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to integrating AI and optimizing production processes. While it mentions AI and GenAI, it doesn't delve into the specifics of AI model development or deep AI specialization. The tasks are predominantly focused on the engineering and integration aspects of applying these technologies within a production environment. The confidence is high because the tasks align well with the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile, but not a perfect 5 due to the broadness of terms like 'AI' and 'GenAI' without further context on their specific application within the role."
