While it mentions GenAI agents and Vertex AI (1.B.1, 2.2), the emphasis is on integrating these into broader solutions and collaborating with software engineers. Data pipeline development (1.B.3) is also mentioned, but the core responsibilities lean towards building and integrating software that utilizes AI, rather than deep model development or specialization. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities that fall into both software engineering and AI tasks. The technologies mentioned are specific. The profile assignment is strongly supported by the balance of tasks described. A slightly lower score is given because it's an internship role, which might imply less depth in certain areas compared to a senior role, but the core responsibilities are well-defined."
