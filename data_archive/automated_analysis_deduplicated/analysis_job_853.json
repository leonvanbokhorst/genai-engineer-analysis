While it mentions 'generative AI' as an area to explore, it does not list any specific tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. The core responsibilities and technologies listed (JVM languages, microservices) are firmly rooted in software engineering. Therefore, the 'Software Engineer' profile is the most appropriate."

The mention of generative AI is framed as an area for exploration rather than a core responsibility, making the classification straightforward. The language used consistently points towards a general software engineering role."
