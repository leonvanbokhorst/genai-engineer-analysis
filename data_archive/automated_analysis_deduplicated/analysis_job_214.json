While AI tools and techniques are mentioned for automation and enhancement, the core responsibility is the configuration and integration of CPQ systems. There is no indication of model development, fine-tuning, or deep AI specialization. The role requires understanding business needs and applying technology to solve them, aligning with the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile where AI is used to enhance existing software functionalities rather than being the primary focus of development."

It explicitly states what the role is NOT about (routine admin, isolation, outdated tech), reinforcing the focus on configuration and customer interaction. The AI aspect is present but serves to enhance the core software engineering task, making the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile a strong fit. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the specific AI techniques or models are not detailed, leaving a slight ambiguity on the depth of AI involvement beyond 'applying AI tools'."
