While it mentions AI technologies, it does not detail core AI model development, fine-tuning, or specific GenAI techniques like prompt engineering or RAG (Macro-Category B tasks). The emphasis is on leveraging AI to enhance an existing service, rather than building AI models from scratch. The role also includes educational initiatives and reporting on integration, which are software engineering and collaboration-focused. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

However, it lacks specific technical details about the AI models or frameworks used, which would have increased confidence. The role title 'Customer Support Engineer' is also a bit unusual for this description, but the tasks themselves are clear enough to assign a profile."
