The requirement for 'LLM experience' suggests that AI/ML models will be integrated into the software, fitting the definition of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer who builds software with AI/ML features. The ad does not provide enough detail to suggest a balanced mix of core AI tasks (Macro-Category B) required for a Core GenAI Engineer."
