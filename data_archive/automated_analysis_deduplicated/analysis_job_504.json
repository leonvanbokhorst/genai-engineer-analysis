While it mentions leveraging GenAI and LLM models, the core responsibilities described are those of a team lead managing software development processes and people. There are no specific tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. The role is about integrating AI capabilities into a larger framework (RL Silicon generation framework) rather than specializing in the AI models themselves. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

The mention of GenAI and LLM is present but does not dominate the core tasks, which are primarily managerial and developmental. The confidence is high, but not perfect (5), as the specific nature of the 'ML solution' architecture design could potentially involve deeper ML tasks not detailed in this summary."
