While it mentions experimenting with AI tools like GPT-4 Vision (a Macro-Category B task, 1.B.1), the primary emphasis is on the engineering and integration of these AI capabilities into broader applications and infrastructures, rather than deep model development or specialization in GenAI techniques like prompt engineering or RAG. The role is about building software that *uses* AI, not necessarily specializing in the AI models themselves."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering responsibilities with an AI component. The tasks are well-defined, and the technologies mentioned are specific. The profile assignment is straightforward based on the balance of tasks. A slightly lower score is given because 'AI automations' could be interpreted broadly, but the context leans heavily towards software engineering."
