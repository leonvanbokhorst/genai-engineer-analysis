These tasks fall predominantly under Macro-Category B (AI Specialization). While there is one task related to testing and optimizing developed solutions (1.A.1), the core focus remains on the AI aspects. The explicit mention of LLMs and text models, coupled with the dominance of AI-specific tasks over general software engineering tasks, leads to the 'GenAI Specialist' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite specific about the technologies (LLMs) and the types of tasks involved (designing AI solutions, data preparation, model improvement). The language is clear, although it is in Dutch with English technical terms. The tasks clearly point towards a specialization in GenAI rather than a balanced engineering role."
