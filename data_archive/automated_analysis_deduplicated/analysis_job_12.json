It also requires data science skills like EDA, feature engineering, and model training/testing. While there's a strong emphasis on learning and collaboration, the core tasks lean towards building and deploying AI solutions, with a clear mention of LLMs. The role is not purely software engineering as it heavily involves AI model development and application. It's not a specialist role as it balances development with broader AI/ML techniques. Therefore, 'Core GenAI Engineer' is the most fitting profile due to the blend of AI development tasks and the explicit mention of LLMs."
