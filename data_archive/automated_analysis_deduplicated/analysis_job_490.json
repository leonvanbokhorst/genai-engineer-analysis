While it mentions 'GenAI services' and staying informed on 'AI technologies', the core responsibilities described fall under Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering). There are no specific tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). Therefore, the role is classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, where software engineering is the primary focus, and AI is a component integrated into the product."
