While it involves AI platforms and infrastructure, the core tasks are centered around application support, optimization, and operational aspects (benchmarking, administration) rather than developing or fine-tuning AI models themselves. The role is about enabling others to use AI effectively by ensuring the underlying applications and workflows are efficient and well-managed. This aligns with the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile, which emphasizes Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration, Operations & MLOps) with AI/ML as a context or enabler for the applications being supported."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the responsibilities, focusing on application support and optimization within an AI/HPC environment. The tasks are well-defined, leaning towards operational and integration aspects rather than core AI model development. The profile assignment is strongly supported by the emphasis on application workflows and user support. A slightly lower score is given because 'code optimization' is mentioned without specifying the language, and the primary focus is on supporting existing scientific workloads rather than building new AI-powered features from scratch."
