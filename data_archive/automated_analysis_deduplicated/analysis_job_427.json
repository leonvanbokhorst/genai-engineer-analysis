        "rationale": "The job advertisement heavily emphasizes traditional software engineering tasks such as developing and deploying back-end solutions, conducting code reviews, and integrating AI-driven solutions into existing product lines. While it mentions leveraging AI tools to improve efficiency, the core focus remains on software development and integration rather than deep AI model development or specialization. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software development responsibilities and the integration of AI into those processes. It is less explicit about the depth of AI involvement beyond 'leveraging tools' and 'AI-driven innovations', which prevents a perfect score. However, the emphasis on back-end development, cloud-native applications, and code reviews strongly points towards a software engineering role with an AI component."
