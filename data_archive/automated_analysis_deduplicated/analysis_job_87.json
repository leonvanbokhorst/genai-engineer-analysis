While it mentions exploring 'LLMs and other transformer-based models', this is presented as an area of exploration rather than a primary focus. The majority of the tasks involve software development (1.A.1) like deploying cloud platforms, developing tools (Shiny, PowerBI), and implementing pipelines. However, the core ML aspect is present in the 'modelling workflows' and 'ML pipelines' in R, and the exploration of new models. It's not a GenAI Specialist as the emphasis is not on GenAI tasks like prompt engineering or RAG. It's not an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer because the ML/model aspect is more than just integration; it involves critique and exploration of workflows. Therefore, 'Core ML Engineer' best fits the balanced mix of software engineering tasks with a significant, though not exclusively GenAI-focused, ML component."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite detailed in its responsibilities, clearly outlining both software development and ML-related tasks. The mention of LLMs and transformer models indicates an awareness of GenAI, but the core focus remains on traditional ML workflows and general software engineering. The confidence is high, but not perfect, as the balance between traditional ML and GenAI exploration could be interpreted slightly differently, and the specific profile assignment relies on weighing these aspects."
