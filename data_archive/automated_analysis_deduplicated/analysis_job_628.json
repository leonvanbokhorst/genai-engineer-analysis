    "profile": {
        "assigned_profile": "AI-Adjacent Software Engineer",
        "rationale": "The job ad focuses on developing and operationalizing an 'innovatieplatform' and 'proeven' (trials/experiments). While AI is implied by the context of 'proeven' and the title mentioning 'AI ontwikkelaar', the core tasks described are about building and integrating functional platforms and operationalizing proofs of concept. There are no specific mentions of generative AI tasks (like LLMs, RAG, prompt engineering) or traditional ML model development. The primary emphasis is on software development and integration (Macro-Category A) to support AI initiatives, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 3,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite brief and uses general terms like 'innovatieplatform' and 'proeven'. While 'AI ontwikkelaar' is in the title, the description of tasks lacks specific details about the AI/ML components being developed or integrated. The mention of 'Azure platform' is the only concrete technical detail. This makes it difficult to definitively classify the role's specific AI focus or the depth of AI involvement, leading to a moderate confidence score."
