While it mentions exploring GenAI, LLM, and Copilots, these are presented as areas for learning and exploration rather than core responsibilities. The role's main function is to manage and engineer the underlying cloud infrastructure and pipelines, which will likely support AI/ML initiatives, but the direct development or specialization in AI models is not the primary focus. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile, where the role builds or maintains software that supports AI/ML features, but is not primarily focused on the AI/ML tasks themselves."

The mention of GenAI, LLM, and Copilots is present but framed as an area for exploration and learning, not as a primary technical requirement. This makes the classification as 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' quite clear, though a score of 5 would require more explicit AI/ML task descriptions."
