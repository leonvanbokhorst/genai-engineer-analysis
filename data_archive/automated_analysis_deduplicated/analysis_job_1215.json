While AI, GenAI, ML, and NLP are mentioned as techniques used by the team, the specific responsibilities listed for this role do not involve developing, fine-tuning, or integrating AI/ML models themselves. The tasks are primarily about building and maintaining the data infrastructure that might support these techniques, aligning with Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering) without explicit tasks from Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization)."

However, the mention of AI/GenAI/ML/NLP as techniques used by the team, without detailing specific tasks for this role involving these techniques, leaves a slight ambiguity. The classification as 'Software Engineer' is strong based on the explicit tasks, but the context could imply a role that interfaces with AI/ML systems without directly building them."
