While AI is mentioned, the core responsibilities are in building and enhancing software systems, with AI serving as an accelerator rather than the central focus of model development or specialization. Client consultation also points to understanding business needs to deliver software solutions. There are no tasks related to core AI model development or deep GenAI specialization (Macro-Category B)."
