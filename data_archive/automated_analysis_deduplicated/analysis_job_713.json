While it mentions MLOps and data pipelines, there is no mention of Generative AI, LLMs, RAG, or related technologies. The tasks are predominantly in Macro-Category B (Model Development & Fine-Tuning, Data Engineering & Management) with some elements of Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration, Operations & MLOps). Given the strong emphasis on predictive modeling and the absence of GenAI specifics, it aligns best with a Core ML Engineer profile."
