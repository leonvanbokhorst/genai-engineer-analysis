It also lists core software engineering tasks like building scalable applications, improving functionalities, and participating in technical strategy. The required technologies include Python, Generative AI models, Ray, FastAPI, Docker, CI/CD, and cloud platforms. While there's a strong emphasis on software engineering (Macro-Category A), the explicit mention of Generative AI models and ML algorithms, coupled with the need to develop them, points towards a balanced mix of A and B tasks with a focus on GenAI. Therefore, 'Core GenAI Engineer' is the most fitting profile."
