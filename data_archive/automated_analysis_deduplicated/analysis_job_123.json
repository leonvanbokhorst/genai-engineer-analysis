It mentions Generative AI as one of several innovative solutions being developed. The core tasks described are traditional software development and integration (Macro-Category A), with no specific tasks related to AI model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). Therefore, the role is classified as a Software Engineer."

While Generative AI is mentioned as an area of innovation, the core responsibilities are rooted in general software development and integration, making the profile assignment straightforward. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the mention of Generative AI could imply a deeper involvement than what is explicitly detailed."
