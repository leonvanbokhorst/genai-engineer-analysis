There are no descriptive sentences or phrases that can be mapped to any of the job task categories (Macro-Category A or B) defined in the CODING_BOOK.md. A Customer Success Engineer role typically focuses on customer support, onboarding, and relationship management, rather than core software engineering or AI/ML development/specialization."
