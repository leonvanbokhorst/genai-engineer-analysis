The tasks described are predominantly within Macro-Category A, with AI/RAG being specific technologies used within that framework. The distinction between this role and a 'Core GenAI Engineer' or 'GenAI Specialist' is clear due to the lack of emphasis on model training, fine-tuning, or deep AI research."
