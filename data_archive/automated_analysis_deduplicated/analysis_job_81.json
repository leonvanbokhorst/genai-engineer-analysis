        "rationale": "The job advertisement focuses heavily on traditional software engineering tasks such as developing scalable backend systems, working with cloud technologies, implementing infrastructure, ensuring test coverage, and collaborating with other engineering teams. While it mentions 'LLM applications', the core responsibilities described are not about building, fine-tuning, or directly engineering with LLMs themselves, but rather building the platform that supports them. There are no tasks related to prompt engineering, RAG, model development, or specialized AI data engineering. Therefore, the role is classified as a 'Software Engineer' as it primarily involves building software infrastructure rather than specializing in AI/ML model development or GenAI tasks."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is very clear about the core responsibilities being traditional software engineering. While LLMs are mentioned as the target application, the tasks themselves are firmly rooted in backend development, cloud infrastructure, and integration, with no specific AI/ML model development or GenAI specialization tasks described. This makes the classification straightforward."
