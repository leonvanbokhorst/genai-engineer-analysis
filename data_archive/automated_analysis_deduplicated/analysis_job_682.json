While it explicitly states 'Coding or programming' is NOT part of the role, the core responsibilities revolve around integrating and applying AI-driven services within a consulting framework. The tasks are primarily focused on the application and delivery of AI-enhanced services (Macro-Category A), rather than the development or fine-tuning of AI models themselves (Macro-Category B). Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile, which focuses on building or maintaining software that uses AI as a core part of its functionality, even if direct coding is not the primary activity."

The explicit mention of 'NOT doing coding or programming' helps in distinguishing it from other profiles. However, the absence of specific technologies mentioned and the broad description of 'AI-Enhanced Project Delivery' prevent a perfect score."
