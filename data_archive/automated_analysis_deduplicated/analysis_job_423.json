        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on traditional software engineering tasks such as developing back-end solutions, deploying applications, conducting code reviews, and enhancing product functionality. While it mentions leveraging 'cutting-edge AI tools' and 'AI-driven innovations' and integrating 'AI-driven solutions', the core responsibilities described are within Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering). There are no explicit tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or specific AI/ML model management (Macro-Category B). Therefore, the role is classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, where AI is used to enhance existing software engineering practices and product features, rather than being the primary focus of model building or specialization."
    },
    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering responsibilities. The mention of AI is in the context of improving efficiency and integrating solutions, rather than core AI/ML model development. The absence of specific AI/ML technologies or tasks from Macro-Category B makes the classification straightforward. A slightly lower score is given because the term 'AI-driven innovations' could be interpreted more broadly, but the surrounding context strongly points to software engineering with AI augmentation."
