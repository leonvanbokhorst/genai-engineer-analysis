The role involves building and managing ML infrastructure, compute clusters, and MLOps tooling. It does not involve the development or integration of AI/ML models themselves, nor does the output of the role constitute an AI-powered feature or system. Instead, it provides the foundational platform and infrastructure that enables ML teams to perform their work. This aligns with the definition of a Software Engineer who operates within the AI/ML ecosystem but does not build the AI components directly."
