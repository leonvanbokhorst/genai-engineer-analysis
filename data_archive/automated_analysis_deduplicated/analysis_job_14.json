There is no mention of Generative AI specific tasks or technologies. The presence of both ML implementation and software engineering tasks, with a clear emphasis on traditional ML, points to the 'Core ML Engineer' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is clear about the core responsibilities, which include implementing ML models and software engineering tasks. However, it lacks specific technology mentions, which would have provided further clarity. The absence of any GenAI specific terms makes the 'Core ML Engineer' classification highly probable, but the lack of explicit technology stack prevents a perfect score."
