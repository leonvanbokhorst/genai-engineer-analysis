        "rationale": "The job description heavily emphasizes traditional software engineering tasks (1.A.1) such as developing, integrating, deploying, and maintaining applications, features, and backend solutions. While AI and GenAI are central to the product development (e.g., RAG, GPT-4, generative AI features, ML algorithms for insights), the role's primary focus is on integrating these AI components into existing software products and enhancing the software itself. The tasks are predominantly about building and enhancing software that *uses* AI, rather than deep specialization in AI model development or research. There are mentions of RAG and GPT-4, but the tasks described are integration and application-level, not model training or fine-tuning. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile, where the core is software engineering, augmented by AI integration."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 5,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is very clear about the responsibilities, explicitly mentioning the integration of AI features into existing product lines and detailing various software development tasks. The technologies mentioned (GPT-4, RAG) are specific to GenAI, but the overall framing of the role is about building and enhancing software products with these capabilities, aligning well with the AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."
