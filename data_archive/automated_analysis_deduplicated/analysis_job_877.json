        "rationale": "The job description heavily emphasizes traditional software engineering tasks such as 'development', 'integration', 'architecting', and 'optimizing implementations' within an AWS infrastructure. While it mentions specific AI technologies like GPT-4 Vision and Amazon CodeWhisperer, the core responsibilities are focused on building and deploying AI automation systems and integrating AI technologies into development processes. There is no mention of core ML model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG as primary tasks. The role is about building software that *uses* AI, rather than specializing in the AI models themselves. The statement 'our AI-first approach means you'll focus on strategic implementation rather than routine development' further reinforces that the core is software engineering, albeit with an AI focus."

The distinction between what the role *will* and *will not* do helps to solidify the classification. The mention of specific AI tools is contextual to their integration into software development, not their core development or specialization."
