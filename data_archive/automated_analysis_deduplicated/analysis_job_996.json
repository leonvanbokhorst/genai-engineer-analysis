        "rationale": "The job ad focuses exclusively on tasks related to training, evaluating, and refining generative AI models ('help train AI models', 'helping cutting-edge generative AI models write better code', 'Evaluating and ranking code generated by AI models'). There are no mentions of core software engineering tasks like building applications, developing APIs, or managing production infrastructure (Macro-Category A). The tasks described fall squarely into Macro-Category B, specifically under 'Model Development & Fine-Tuning' (1.B.1). While the role is described as being for an 'experienced software engineer', the actual responsibilities are specialized towards AI model interaction and training, not general software development. Therefore, 'GenAI Specialist' is the most appropriate profile."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is clear about the AI-focused tasks involved in training and evaluating models. However, it's a bit light on specific technical details or the broader software engineering context that might be expected for a more senior or integrated role. The mention of 'Front-End Developer' in the title seems contradictory to the described tasks, which are more aligned with AI model interaction and training rather than front-end development. This discrepancy slightly reduces the confidence."
