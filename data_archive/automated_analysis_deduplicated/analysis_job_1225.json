There is no mention of software engineering tasks (Macro-Category A) or specific Generative AI tasks (Prompt Engineering, RAG, LLM frameworks). This indicates a primary focus on traditional ML model development, fitting the 'ML Specialist (Data Scientist)' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is extremely brief and lacks detail regarding specific technologies, methodologies, or the scope of 'ML based solutions'. While it points towards ML model development, it doesn't provide enough information to confidently assign a more specific profile or assess the breadth of responsibilities. The 'Required' section is also empty, further limiting the analysis."
