        "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on integrating AI capabilities into customer resolution processes and improving AI systems ('Software Development & Integration' tasks). While there's a mention of 'AI model fine-tuning sessions', the primary emphasis is on applying human expertise to enhance existing AI systems and customer support workflows, rather than core AI model development or specialized GenAI tasks like prompt engineering or RAG. The role is about making AI work better within a broader application context."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to AI integration and improvement within a support context. The tasks lean towards enhancing existing systems rather than deep AI model creation. The profile assignment is straightforward based on this emphasis. A slightly lower score is given because the 'fine-tuning' aspect could be interpreted in multiple ways, but the overall context points strongly to an AI-adjacent role."
