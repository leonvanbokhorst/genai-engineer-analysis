        "rationale": "The job ad focuses exclusively on tasks related to training and evaluating AI models, specifically generative AI models. The core responsibilities involve 'crafting and answering questions' and 'evaluating and ranking code generated by AI models' to help train these models. These tasks fall under Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization) and specifically under 'Model Development & Fine-Tuning' (1.B.1). There are no tasks mentioned that fall under Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering), such as software development, integration, or MLOps. Therefore, the role is predominantly focused on the AI specialization aspect, leading to the 'ML Specialist (Data Scientist)' profile, with the understanding that the specialization here is in GenAI rather than traditional ML, but the profile category best fits the task distribution."

The profile assignment is straightforward based on the task focus, but the lack of detail on specific technologies or engineering practices prevents a perfect score."
