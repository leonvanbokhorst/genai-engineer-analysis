        "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on integrating AI capabilities into customer support resolutions and improving AI systems through feedback and fine-tuning. While there's mention of AI model fine-tuning, the core emphasis is on applying and improving existing AI within a support function, rather than developing novel AI models from scratch. The tasks are primarily about enhancing a software system (customer support) with AI, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile. There are no explicit mentions of traditional ML or GenAI specialist tasks like model architecture design, prompt engineering, or data engineering for model training."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to AI integration and improvement within a support context. However, it lacks specific technical tool mentions and doesn't delve deeply into the nuances of AI model development, making the classification lean towards 'AI-Adjacent' rather than a more specialized AI role. The emphasis on rapid ramp-up and self-sufficiency is clear, but the AI-specific technical depth is less defined."
