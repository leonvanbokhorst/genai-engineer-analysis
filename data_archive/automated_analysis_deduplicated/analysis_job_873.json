While AI and GenAI are mentioned as tools, the core responsibilities are centered around software engineering practices (testing, automation, integration) rather than developing or specializing in AI/ML models themselves. The role is about applying AI to enhance software engineering tasks, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile, but given the lack of explicit AI model development or integration into the product's core functionality, and the focus being on QA, 'Software Engineer' is a more fitting primary classification as per the coding book's emphasis on the nature of the *product* being built or maintained."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to test automation and leveraging AI for quality assurance. However, the specific AI/GenAI tasks are described in the context of testing tools rather than core product development, making the distinction between 'Software Engineer' and 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' slightly nuanced. The mention of 'AI-driven test automation frameworks' and 'Leverage GenAI tools' points towards AI integration, but the primary output is still a QA framework, not an AI-powered product feature."
