While AI is mentioned as a context for the applications, the core tasks described are traditional software development and integration. The use of Python and Javascript is incidental for data transformation and custom functions. There is no mention of core AI/ML model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, as it builds software that is AI-enabled but not focused on the AI models themselves."

    "confidence": {

        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the primary tools and the nature of the development (low-code focused). However, the mention of '(gen)AI toepassingen' and 'complexe AI-concepten' is somewhat general, and it's not entirely clear if there's any deeper AI involvement beyond integration. The focus on FlutterFlow as the primary tool strongly suggests a software engineering role with an AI context."
