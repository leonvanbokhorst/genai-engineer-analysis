        "rationale": "The job description primarily focuses on developing and maintaining applications using the Pega platform, with a specific emphasis on integrating GenAI capabilities into case management. The core tasks fall under 'Software Development & Integration' (1.A.1). While GenAI is mentioned, the role is not about developing novel GenAI models or deep prompt engineering but rather about integrating existing AI-driven solutions into the Pega framework. There are no explicit mentions of traditional ML tasks or advanced GenAI specialization tasks like fine-tuning or RAG implementation. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile, where the primary focus is software engineering with AI integration."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the primary responsibilities and the technology stack (Pega). The mention of GenAI is present but framed as an integration aspect rather than a core development focus. The tasks are well-defined, leading to a confident assignment of the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile. A slightly lower score is given because the depth of GenAI involvement is not extensively detailed, leaving some room for interpretation on the complexity of the AI integration."
