While there is an explicit mention of working with ML models and AI knowledge, the primary emphasis remains on the software engineering aspects of integrating and improving an AI-powered product (GenIA-L). The role is described as a 'back-end developer with an interest in AI', and the AI-related tasks are presented as opportunities for growth and improvement of an existing AI product, rather than the core focus of model development or specialization. Therefore, the profile 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting as it involves building software that uses AI features, with a strong foundation in software engineering."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software development responsibilities and mentions AI/ML in the context of improving an existing product. The distinction between core AI tasks and software integration is reasonably clear. However, the depth of involvement in actual ML model experimentation is described as an 'opportunity' and not a primary daily task, which makes it slightly less definitive than a role explicitly focused on model building."
