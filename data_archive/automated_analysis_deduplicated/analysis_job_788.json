        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on the application of Artificial Intelligence, specifically mentioning 'generative AI' and 'data driven digital tools' in the context of renewable energy projects. While it mentions 'developing few innovative ideas', the core tasks described lean towards applying existing AI/ML concepts and data-driven approaches rather than building core software infrastructure or integrating AI into existing applications. There's no mention of traditional software engineering tasks like building microservices, CI/CD pipelines, or production-grade code. The emphasis is on the AI/ML aspect within a specific domain (renewable energy) and learning consultancy skills, which aligns best with an ML Specialist role focused on applying AI/ML techniques."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 3,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is somewhat vague about the specific AI tasks. While it mentions 'Artificial Intelligence' and 'generative AI', it doesn't detail specific model development, fine-tuning, or prompt engineering activities. The role seems to be more about applying AI in a business context and learning consultancy skills, which makes it lean towards an ML Specialist but lacks the depth to be definitively classified as a 'Core GenAI Engineer' or 'GenAI Specialist'. The mention of 'electrical engineer' in the title also adds a layer of ambiguity regarding the primary focus."
