        "rationale": "The job ad heavily emphasizes traditional software engineering tasks (1.A.1) such as developing production-grade ML systems, building robust code, managing pipelines, and evaluating architectures. It also includes significant operational and MLOps responsibilities (1.A.2) like monitoring, data governance, and SLOs. While it mentions 'ML/AI' and 'GenAI Studio' in the title, the detailed responsibilities focus on the engineering and operational aspects of ML systems rather than specific Generative AI tasks like prompt engineering or fine-tuning LLMs. The soft skills are also general. Therefore, it aligns best with a Core ML Engineer role that builds and maintains ML systems, rather than a GenAI Specialist or a GenAI Engineer focused on generative models."
    },
    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is detailed and clearly outlines responsibilities. The primary focus on production-grade ML systems, pipelines, monitoring, and governance strongly points towards a traditional ML engineering role. The mention of 'GENAI Studio' in the title is the only element that could suggest a GenAI focus, but the body of the description does not elaborate on specific GenAI tasks. This slight ambiguity prevents a perfect score, but the overall emphasis on core ML engineering is clear."
