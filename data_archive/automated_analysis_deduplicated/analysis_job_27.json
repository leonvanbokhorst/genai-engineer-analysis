        "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on front-end engineering tasks (exposing functionality, building interfaces, ensuring customer adoption) which fall under Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration). While it mentions 'generative AI' as the technology domain, the core responsibilities are about building the user-facing application and integrating these concepts, rather than developing or fine-tuning AI models themselves. There are no explicit tasks related to Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization). Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly defines the role as a front-end engineer and its primary responsibilities. While it mentions 'generative AI', it does not delve into specific AI/ML tasks, making the classification of the role straightforward. The confidence is high, but not perfect (5), as the ad could have provided more detail on the specific front-end technologies or the nature of the 'state-of-the-art concepts' being implemented."
