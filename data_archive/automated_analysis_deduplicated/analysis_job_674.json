While AI and GenAI concepts (RAG, GPT-4, generative AI) are mentioned and are integral to the features being built, the core responsibilities and the majority of the coded phrases fall under Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering). The role is about building software that *uses* AI, rather than focusing on the deep technical aspects of AI model development or specialization. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

The use of specific AI technologies like RAG and GPT-4 is mentioned within the context of building features, reinforcing the AI-adjacent nature of the role. The distinction between building AI-powered features and specializing in AI development is clear."
