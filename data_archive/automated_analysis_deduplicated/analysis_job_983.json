        "rationale": "The job ad seeks an experienced software engineer to apply their coding expertise to train AI models. While it involves AI training, the primary emphasis is on leveraging existing software engineering skills ('lend your coding expertise') for AI model improvement, rather than deep AI model development or GenAI specialization. The tasks described are more about applying software engineering principles to an AI-related task (training) rather than building AI systems from scratch or specializing in GenAI techniques like RAG or prompt engineering. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."
    },
    "confidence": {
        "score": 3,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite brief and focuses heavily on the payment structure and contract details. While it mentions 'software engineer' and 'train AI models', it lacks specific details about the nature of the software development tasks or the depth of AI involvement. The core responsibilities are not elaborated upon, making it difficult to definitively classify the role beyond a general AI-adjacent software engineering position. The mention of 'generative AI models' is present but not the sole focus of the described activities."
