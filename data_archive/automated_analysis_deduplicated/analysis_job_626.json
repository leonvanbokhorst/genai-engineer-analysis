        "rationale": "The job advertisement focuses heavily on traditional software development tasks across frontend, backend, API integration, database management, performance optimization, and testing. While it mentions 'AI model integration' and collaboration with AI/data science teams, it does not detail any tasks related to the development, fine-tuning, or specific application of Generative AI models themselves. The core responsibilities are software engineering, with AI/ML being integrated components rather than the primary focus of development. Therefore, the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile is the most fitting."

The distinction between core software engineering and AI specialization is evident, with the role clearly falling into the former category with AI integration as a component. There is no ambiguity regarding the nature of the tasks described."
