These are core software engineering tasks (Macro-Category A). While the role mentions 'generative AI' and creating 'AI-generated educational content' and an 'AI learning copilot,' the specific tasks described do not involve model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG implementation (Macro-Category B). The focus is on building the software applications that integrate these AI capabilities. Therefore, the profile is AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

The mention of AI is in the context of the product's domain and features, not the core technical tasks of the role itself. The distinction between building the application and building/specializing in AI models is clear from the task descriptions."
