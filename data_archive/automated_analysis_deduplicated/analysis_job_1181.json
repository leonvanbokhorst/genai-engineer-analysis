        "rationale": "The job description heavily emphasizes traditional software engineering tasks such as designing, implementing, maintaining, monitoring, and debugging backend services. It also involves collaboration across teams and defining interfaces. While the role requires bringing 'model functionality' to end-users through integrations, there is no mention of developing, fine-tuning, or engineering prompts for AI/ML models themselves. The primary focus remains on building and operating the software infrastructure that supports these models, making it an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer role."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is clear about the core software engineering responsibilities and the use of C#. It also clearly indicates collaboration with research teams to integrate model functionality. However, it lacks specific details about the *nature* of the models or the AI/ML technologies involved, which would have made the classification of 'AI-Adjacent' even more certain. The focus is on the *backend engineering* aspect of integrating AI, rather than the AI itself. This makes it a strong candidate for 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer', but not a definitive 'Core GenAI Engineer' or 'Core ML Engineer' as those would require more explicit AI/ML development tasks. The confidence is high because the software engineering aspects are very clear, and the AI integration is implied strongly enough."
