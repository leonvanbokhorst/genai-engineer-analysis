        "rationale": "The job advertisement lists responsibilities that are exclusively within Macro-Category B. Specifically, it includes significant data engineering tasks (1.B.3. Data Engineering & Management) and traditional machine learning modeling tasks (1.B.1. Model Development & Fine-Tuning for predictive analysis). There are no tasks related to core software engineering (Macro-Category A) or generative AI. This aligns with the definition of an ML Specialist (Data Scientist) profile, which is characterized by a focus on traditional ML tasks and being predominantly in Macro-Category B."

However, the absence of specific technologies and the slight ambiguity in categorizing visualization prevent a perfect score. The profile assignment is strongly supported by the task distribution."
