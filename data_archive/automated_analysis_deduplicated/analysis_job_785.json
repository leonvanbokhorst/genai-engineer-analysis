While 'generative AI' is mentioned as a technology to advise on, the core tasks are not about developing or fine-tuning GenAI models (Category 1.B.1) or prompt engineering (Category 1.B.2). The role is about building and maintaining IT solutions that handle data, with AI being a potential area of advice rather than a core development focus. Therefore, it's an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer role."

The mention of 'generative AI' is in the context of advising on technologies, not as a primary development task. The tasks align well with the 'Data Engineering & Management' category. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the mention of generative AI could be interpreted in slightly different ways, though the overall context points strongly to a data engineering role."
