While generative AI is mentioned as a tool to 'expand horizons' and is the basis for product features like TeachTap and TeachTales, the role's responsibilities do not focus on model development, fine-tuning, or prompt engineering (Macro-Category B). Instead, the engineer is tasked with integrating these AI capabilities into the product, transforming requirements, and ensuring scalability and reliability. This profile fits 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' as it's primarily a software engineering role that builds or maintains software using AI/ML as a core component, rather than specializing in the AI/ML models themselves."
