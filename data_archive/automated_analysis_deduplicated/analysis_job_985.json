        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on tasks related to training and evaluating generative AI models by providing feedback on their code generation. While it mentions 'software engineer' as a background, the core responsibilities (making/answering questions for training, evaluating AI-generated code) fall under GenAI Specialization (Macro-Category B), specifically Prompt Engineering & RAG (1.B.2) and Model Development & Fine-Tuning (1.B.1). There are no explicit tasks related to traditional software development or MLOps (Macro-Category A). Therefore, the 'GenAI Specialist' profile is the most appropriate."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the core tasks related to AI model training and evaluation using human feedback. While it's a freelance role with flexible hours, the nature of the work is well-defined. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the 'software engineer' background mentioned could imply some integration tasks, but these are not explicitly detailed in the responsibilities."
