While it mentions 'AI / model based solutions' and 'AI components', it does not detail specific Generative AI tasks like prompt engineering, RAG, or fine-tuning of LLMs (Macro-Category B). The focus is on the engineering and integration of AI into broader systems, making it an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer role."

The emphasis is clearly on the software engineering side of AI implementation."
