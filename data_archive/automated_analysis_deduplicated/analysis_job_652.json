While AI is mentioned, the core responsibilities are rooted in software engineering and business intelligence, with AI serving as an accelerator rather than the central focus of model development or specialized GenAI tasks. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities and technologies. The mention of AI is present but contextualized within existing BI solutions, making the profile assignment relatively straightforward. A slightly lower score is given because the AI aspect is described as an accelerator rather than a deep dive into AI model development, leaving a small room for interpretation on the depth of AI involvement."
