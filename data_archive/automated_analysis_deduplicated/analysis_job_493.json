        "rationale": "The job ad clearly states the team builds 'AI-powered tools that suggest intelligent code to developers' and 'integrating large language models (LLMs)'. It explicitly mentions 'prompt engineering' and lists projects like 'AI-powered Code Suggestion feature', 'scan repositories for context to make suggestions better', and 'explain code and write tests' using AI. These are all core Generative AI tasks (Macro-Category B). The role also heavily emphasizes traditional software engineering tasks like 'contributing high-quality code', 'collaborative code reviews', 'feature development', 'secure, well-tested, and performant way', 'maintainability, and best practices for a high-scale web environment', and 'troubleshooting product operations' (Macro-Category A). Given the balanced mix of both core software engineering and specific Generative AI tasks, the profile of 'Core GenAI Engineer' is the most appropriate."

        "reasoning": "The job advertisement is very clear about the team's focus on Generative AI (LLMs, code suggestion, explanation) and explicitly mentions prompt engineering. It also details numerous core software engineering responsibilities, including development, testing, collaboration, and operational aspects. The alignment between the described tasks and the 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile is strong and unambiguous."
