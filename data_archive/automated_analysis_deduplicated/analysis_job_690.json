All identified tasks fall under `1.A.1. Software Development & Integration`. The role explicitly states it is *not* for new feature development or architecture. While the ad mentions 'leveraging AI and automation' and an 'AI-first environment,' these are described as tools for efficiency in delivery, not as core responsibilities for developing or integrating AI/ML models into the product. The primary technology mentioned is `Java`. Therefore, the role is classified as a `Software Engineer` as it involves traditional software engineering tasks on a non-AI product, with AI/automation used as supporting tools."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 5,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is very specific about the scope of responsibilities, clearly distinguishing between core tasks (maintenance, deployment, testing) and excluded activities (new features, architecture). The mention of AI is contextual and does not imply AI development. This clarity leads to a high confidence score."
