        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on software development tasks (prototyping, backend/API development, iterative improvement) within Macro-Category A. While it mentions leveraging generative AI and conversational agents (Macro-Category B), the core responsibility is translating these technologies into a product. There's no indication of deep model development, fine-tuning, or specialized prompt engineering. The role is about building software that *uses* AI, rather than being solely focused on the AI models themselves. The mention of potentially taking a leadership role also aligns with a senior software engineering capacity within an AI-focused product."

The profile assignment is strong, but the lack of specific AI technologies mentioned (like specific LLMs, frameworks, or vector databases) prevents a perfect score. The mention of 'generative AI technology' and 'conversational agents' is somewhat general."
