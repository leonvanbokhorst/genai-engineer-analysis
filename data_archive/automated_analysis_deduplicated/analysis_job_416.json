While it mentions 'Play around with LLM' and 'Stay updated with the latest advancements in AI', these are not the core responsibilities and do not indicate deep involvement in model development, fine-tuning, or specialized GenAI tasks. The role is described as a 'Senior Backend Developer', reinforcing the software engineering foundation. Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, where AI/ML is a component integrated into a broader software engineering context, rather than the primary focus."

The profile assignment is strongly supported by the emphasis on backend development and GCP stack. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as 'Play around with LLM' is somewhat vague and could imply more depth than initially apparent, though the overall context leans heavily towards software engineering."
