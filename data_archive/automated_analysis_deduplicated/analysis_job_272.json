It explicitly mentions developing generative AI solutions with LLMs (1.B.2) and integrating AI models into business processes (1.A.1), as well as building solutions for production environments (1.A.1). The technologies mentioned (OpenAI, Azure AI) are also strongly associated with GenAI. While there's a mention of automating decision-making with ML (1.B.1), the emphasis on LLMs and integration into business processes, coupled with the software engineering aspects of production deployment and architecture, points towards a Core GenAI Engineer role."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to both GenAI development (LLMs) and software engineering (integration, production deployment, architecture). The mention of specific technologies like OpenAI further solidifies the GenAI aspect. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the 'automating decision-making with machine learning' could be interpreted as traditional ML, but the overall context leans heavily towards GenAI."
