While it mentions generative AI tools, it explicitly states 'Coding or programming' is NOT part of the role. The core tasks involve consulting, gathering requirements, advising, and configuring software platforms, all of which are primarily software engineering and business-oriented tasks (Macro-Category A). There are no tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG implementation (Macro-Category B). Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, as it integrates AI into software delivery without focusing on AI model specifics."

The tasks described align well with the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, because the term 'Implementation Engineer' could sometimes imply deeper technical involvement, but the explicit exclusion of coding and the focus on consulting and configuration make the classification reasonably certain."
