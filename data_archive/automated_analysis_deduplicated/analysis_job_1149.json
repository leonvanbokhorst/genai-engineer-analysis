While AI is a significant component, the focus is on integrating AI-driven solutions into existing product lines and using AI tools to enhance the software development process. There is a mention of 'implementing machine learning algorithms for predictive insights' and 'RAG approach with OpenAI's GPT-4', which touches upon AI specialization (1.B.1 and 1.B.2), but these are presented as features to be integrated rather than the primary focus of model development or deep AI research. The role is primarily about building and enhancing software products that *use* AI, rather than building the AI models themselves. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

The distinction between building software that uses AI versus building AI models is evident. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as there's a slight overlap with AI specialization tasks, but the overall framing strongly points to an AI-adjacent software engineering role."
