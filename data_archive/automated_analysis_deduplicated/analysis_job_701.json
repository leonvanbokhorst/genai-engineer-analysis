While AI is central to the role, the tasks described (AI System Building, Service Configuration and Maintenance, incident management) fall primarily under Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering), specifically Software Development & Integration and Operations. There is no mention of model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG, which are characteristic of Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization). The role is about using AI tools to improve existing processes and systems, rather than developing or specializing in AI models themselves. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the responsibilities and distinguishes what the role *is* and *is not*. It emphasizes the use of AI tools to enhance operational efficiency and system maintenance, rather than core AI model development. The tasks are clearly mapped to software engineering and operational aspects. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as some phrases could be interpreted slightly differently, but the overall picture is very clear."
