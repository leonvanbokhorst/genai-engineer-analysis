        "rationale": "The job description heavily emphasizes core software engineering tasks such as 'architect, implement and scale industry-leading security solutions' and 'drive the development and operations of security services and frameworks' (Categories 1.A.1 and 1.A.2). While ML/GenAI is mentioned in the context of 'adoption' and tasks like 'Analyzing security threats and vulnerabilities to develop strategies for detection and mitigation' and 'Researching new techniques and tools' (Category 1.B.1), these are framed as enhancements to security solutions rather than the primary focus of building general AI/ML models. The title 'Software Engineer II - Security & ML' further indicates a software engineering role augmented by ML/GenAI expertise, making it an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job advertisement clearly outlines the primary responsibilities as software engineering within the security domain, with ML/GenAI serving as an integrated component. The distinction between core software engineering and AI specialization is evident, allowing for a confident profile assignment. A score of 4 reflects high confidence, with minor ambiguity in the precise depth of ML/GenAI model development versus application."
