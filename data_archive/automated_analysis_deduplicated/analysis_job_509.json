While 'generative AI' is mentioned as a tool used in the process, the core responsibilities described are about building and maintaining the software infrastructure that supports these operations, rather than developing or fine-tuning AI models themselves. The role integrates AI/ML capabilities into the broader life science R&D software stack, making it an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering responsibilities and mentions the use of generative AI as part of the workflow. However, the specific tasks related to AI/ML are more about integration and operationalization (ML Ops) rather than core model development. The mention of 'generative AI' is brief and contextual, not the primary focus of the role's technical depth. This makes the classification as 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' strong, but not a 'Core GenAI Engineer' due to the lack of deep GenAI model development tasks."
