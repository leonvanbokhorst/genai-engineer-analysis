        "reasoning": "The job ad is clear about the tasks involved in training and evaluating AI models. However, it lacks detail on specific technologies or the broader context of the AI models being used (e.g., if they are specifically generative). The mention of 'Web Developer' in the title is slightly confusing given the described tasks, but the core responsibilities point towards AI model interaction."
