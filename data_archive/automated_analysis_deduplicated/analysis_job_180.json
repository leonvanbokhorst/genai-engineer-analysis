        "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on traditional software engineering tasks such as developing, deploying, testing, troubleshooting, and documenting applications. While it mentions 'AI-based enterprise applications' and the 'C3 AI Platform', it does not detail specific AI/ML model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG tasks. The role appears to be about building software that *uses* AI capabilities provided by a platform, rather than developing the AI models themselves. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering responsibilities. The 'AI-based' aspect is present but not deeply detailed in terms of specific AI model work, making it lean towards an adjacent role rather than a core AI/ML role. The confidence is high because the tasks are clearly defined as software engineering, but not a perfect 5 because the exact nature of the 'AI-based' component is not elaborated upon beyond platform usage."
