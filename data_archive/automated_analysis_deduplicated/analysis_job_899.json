It also includes testing, validation, and continuous optimization (1.A.2), and ensuring responsible AI application (1.C.1). The emphasis on LLMs and the mix of model-centric tasks with operational aspects (optimization) and business context (impact on customers, responsible AI) points towards a Core GenAI Engineer profile. There are no explicit mentions of traditional ML tasks or purely software engineering tasks without an AI component."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the core responsibilities involving LLMs and AI model development. However, it lacks specific mentions of technologies or tools, and the soft skills are implied rather than explicitly stated. The task of 'Testen, valideren en continu optimaliseren van ontwikkelde oplossingen' could lean towards either model development or MLOps, but given the context of LLMs, it's interpreted as part of the GenAI lifecycle. The classification of 'veilige en verantwoorde toepassing' under Business Understanding & Strategy is a slight interpretation, as it also strongly relates to ethical considerations."
