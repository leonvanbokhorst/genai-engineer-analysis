        "rationale": "The job ad focuses exclusively on tasks related to training and evaluating generative AI models (Macro-Category B, specifically 1.B.1). There are no mentions of software development, integration, or MLOps (Macro-Category A). While it mentions 'software-engineer' in the introduction, the core responsibilities described are centered around AI model training and evaluation, not building software applications that use AI. Therefore, 'GenAI Specialist' is the most fitting profile."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the core tasks involving training and evaluating generative AI models. However, it's a bit light on specific technical details or broader software engineering responsibilities, which prevents a perfect score. The profile assignment is strongly supported by the described tasks."
