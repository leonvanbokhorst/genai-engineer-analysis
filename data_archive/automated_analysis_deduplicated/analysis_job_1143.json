        "rationale": "The job ad primarily focuses on designing, building, integrating, and deploying AI automations and systems (Macro-Category A tasks like 1.A.1 and 1.A.2). While it mentions experimenting with specific AI tools like GPT-4 Vision (a Macro-Category B task, 1.B.1), the emphasis is on integrating these into the developmental process and optimizing their implementation within broader infrastructures. The core responsibility appears to be building and managing AI-powered software solutions rather than deep model development or specialization in GenAI techniques. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to building and integrating AI solutions within existing systems and infrastructure. It mentions specific AI tools but frames their use within a software engineering context. The confidence is high, but not perfect (5), as the depth of AI-specific work beyond integration and experimentation is not fully detailed."
