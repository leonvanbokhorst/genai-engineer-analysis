        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on designing and integrating AI into software development processes (Macro-Category A tasks like 'Design the overarching architecture for AI-driven systems'). While there is mention of R&D into AI technologies (Macro-Category B), the primary emphasis is on leveraging AI to enhance software engineering itself, rather than developing core AI models or GenAI specific applications. The role is about building AI-driven systems that automate software development, making it an AI-adjacent software engineering role."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the responsibilities and the strategic nature of the role. It distinguishes itself from routine coding and emphasizes AI integration into software development. The distinction between AI-adjacent and core AI roles is clear from the description of automating software development processes rather than building generative models themselves. A slightly lower score is given because 'AI Software Engineer' is a broad title, but the description leans towards the AI-adjacent side."
