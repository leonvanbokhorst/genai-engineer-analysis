        "rationale": "The job advertisement focuses heavily on creating and maintaining backend systems ('Macro-Category A'). While it mentions 'generative AI' and 'CGI-powered content solutions', the core responsibilities described are traditional software engineering tasks. The role is about building the platform that *uses* generative AI, rather than developing or specializing in the AI models themselves. There are no explicit tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. Therefore, it fits the profile of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, where the primary focus is software development and integration, with AI/GenAI being a component of the system being built."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly states the primary technology stack (.NET) and the nature of the systems to be built (backend systems for content automation). It mentions generative AI as a component of the solution, but the responsibilities are firmly rooted in software development and integration. The lack of detail on specific AI tasks prevents a higher score, but the overall focus on software engineering is clear."
