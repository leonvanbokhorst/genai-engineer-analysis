The emphasis on both 'Generative AI' and 'Machine Learning' expertise, along with the mention of CI/CD pipelines, indicates a balanced role. The profile is not purely specialist as it includes implementation and operational aspects, nor is it purely AI-adjacent as it focuses on the core AI/ML techniques and architecture rather than just integrating pre-built AI features. Therefore, 'Core GenAI Engineer' is the most fitting profile."
