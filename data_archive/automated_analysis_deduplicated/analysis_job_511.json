        "rationale": "The job title 'Junior Java Engineer' strongly suggests a role focused on traditional software engineering. The advertisement contains no mention of AI/ML tasks or technologies, aligning with the 'Software Engineer' profile which is defined as exclusively performing tasks from Macro-Category A and not integrating AI/ML. However, the extreme brevity of the ad, providing only the title, prevents a detailed mapping of specific tasks to the coding book's categories."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 1,
        "reasoning": "The job advertisement is exceptionally minimal, containing only a job title. This lack of detail prevents a robust analysis of job tasks, technologies, or soft skills according to the coding book's definitions. The profile assignment is based on a weak inference from the title alone, and the absence of any task descriptions means the 'job_tasks' array is empty."
