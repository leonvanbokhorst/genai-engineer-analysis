While it mentions 'modelleren', this is in the context of CI/CD and system designs, not AI/ML models. There are no mentions of AI/ML specific tasks, models, frameworks, or data engineering for AI. The technologies listed are primarily for infrastructure and operations. Therefore, the role is classified as a 'Software Engineer' as it exclusively falls under Macro-Category A without any AI/ML specialization."
