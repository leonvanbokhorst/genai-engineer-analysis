The role is about building and scaling software that *will* interface with AI, making it an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer role."

The distinction between core software engineering and AI specialization is clear enough to assign a profile with high confidence, though the 'AI' aspect is not as deeply integrated as in a 'Core GenAI Engineer' role."
