        "rationale": "The job ad primarily focuses on traditional software engineering tasks such as developing operating systems, real-time applications, embedded software, and optimizing code. While it mentions 'LLM, kunstmatige intelligentie en AI technologieën', these are listed as areas to work with rather than the core focus of model development or specialization. The role is described as 'Junior Software Engineer / Data Science', but the tasks lean heavily towards software engineering (Macro-Category A) with an integration of AI technologies, rather than deep AI/ML model work (Macro-Category B). Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines traditional software engineering responsibilities. The mention of AI/LLM is present but not detailed enough to suggest a specialization in AI/ML model development. The profile assignment is strong, but the 'Data Science' part of the title is not strongly supported by specific tasks, leading to a slightly less than perfect confidence score."
