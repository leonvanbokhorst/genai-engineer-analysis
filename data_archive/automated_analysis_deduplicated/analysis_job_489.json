While it mentions 'Generative AI (GenAI) services' and 'AI technologies', the focus is on building the foundational services and capabilities that *leverage* AI, rather than the deep specialization in model development, fine-tuning, or prompt engineering itself. The tasks fall predominantly under Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering), with AI being the domain of the services being built. There are no specific mentions of traditional ML tasks or GenAI-specific tasks like prompt engineering or RAG implementation. Therefore, the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile is the most fitting."
