While it mentions AI and GenAI capabilities, the core responsibilities fall under Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration, Operations & MLOps). There are no explicit tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, as it involves building and maintaining the infrastructure that supports AI services, rather than developing the AI models themselves."
