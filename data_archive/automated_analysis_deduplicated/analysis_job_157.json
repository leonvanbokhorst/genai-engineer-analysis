        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on 'Prompt Engineering' and 'AI assistant technologies' (Macro-Category B tasks), with a specific mention of Prompt Engineering as a required expertise. While there are elements of software development and integration (Macro-Category A tasks like 'design and implement scalable GenAI solutions' and 'testing and validation'), the core emphasis and the title itself ('Prompt Engineer') point towards a specialization in generative AI tasks rather than a balanced engineering role. The tasks are predominantly focused on the application and refinement of GenAI models, not the broader software engineering lifecycle of a product that *uses* AI."
    },
    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the focus on Prompt Engineering and AI assistants. However, it lacks specific details on the technologies used beyond 'Prompt Engineering' itself and the breadth of the software development tasks involved. This leaves a slight ambiguity in distinguishing between a pure specialist and a role that might have more engineering depth."
