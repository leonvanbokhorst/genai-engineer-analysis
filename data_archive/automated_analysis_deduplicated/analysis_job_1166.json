While it mentions integrating AI and real-time data processing, it does not detail specific AI model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG tasks (Macro-Category B). The emphasis is on building robust, scalable software solutions that happen to incorporate AI, rather than on the AI models themselves. Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

The responsibilities listed are predominantly related to building and integrating software, with AI being a component rather than the core focus of development. The distinction between what the role *will* and *will not* be doing further clarifies this. There is no ambiguity regarding the primary nature of the tasks."
