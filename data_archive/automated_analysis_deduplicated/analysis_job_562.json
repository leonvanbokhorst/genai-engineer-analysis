It also includes developing 'end-to-end solutions' and 'robust solutions that are used in production' (1.A.1, 1.A.2), indicating a blend of ML specialization and software engineering. While generative AI is mentioned, the core focus appears to be on traditional ML, and the role involves both model development and operationalization, fitting the 'Core ML Engineer' profile."

The mention of generative AI is in the context of ethical deployment rather than core development. The tasks align well with the 'Core ML Engineer' profile, though a slightly higher score could be given if the distinction between traditional ML and GenAI tasks was even more pronounced."
