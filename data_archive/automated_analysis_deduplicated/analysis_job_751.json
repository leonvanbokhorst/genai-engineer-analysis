        "rationale": "The role involves a mix of core software engineering tasks (architecture, cloud solution design, building applications) and specific GenAI tasks (development of GenAI-driven applications). The mention of 'GenAI-driven applications' and the need to 'stay abreast of the latest trends in GenAI' points towards a focus on generative AI, while the architecture and cloud solutioning aspects indicate a strong software engineering foundation. This balance aligns with the 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities that map to both software engineering and GenAI specialization. While it mentions 'GenAI-driven applications', it doesn't go into extreme detail about specific GenAI techniques like RAG or fine-tuning, which would have made the classification a 5. However, the overall description is quite clear."
