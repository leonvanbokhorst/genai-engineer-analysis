It also includes some software development (1.A.1) and operational tasks (1.A.2). While it mentions collaboration with LLM engineers and contributing to an AI assistant, the core focus remains on the data infrastructure supporting these AI applications, rather than the development or fine-tuning of the AI models themselves. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile, as the role builds and maintains the software infrastructure that enables AI functionality."
