It also includes MLOps/DevOps related tasks (Docker, Kubernetes, AI deployment pipelines) and product implementation. This mix of core AI/ML development and MLOps, with a specific mention of Generative AI, aligns best with the 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile, suggesting a balanced role between AI specialization and software engineering practices."

While it mentions several relevant technologies and task areas, it lacks specific details about the day-to-day responsibilities or the depth of involvement in each area. This makes a definitive classification slightly challenging, hence a moderate confidence score."
