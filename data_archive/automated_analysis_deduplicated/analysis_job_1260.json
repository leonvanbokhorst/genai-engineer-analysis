        "rationale": "The job description heavily emphasizes traditional software engineering tasks (designing, developing, scaling platforms and services, code reviews, mentoring) which fall under Macro-Category A. While it mentions leveraging AI models and algorithms to transform threat defense, the core focus remains on building and integrating these into a security platform. There are no specific tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). Therefore, the role is classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, as it builds software that directly uses AI/ML features."
