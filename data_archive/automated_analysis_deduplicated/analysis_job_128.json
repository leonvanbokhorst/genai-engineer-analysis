        "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on software development, platform maintenance, migration, and the integration of ML-driven features. While it mentions working with an ML team and adding ML features, the core responsibilities are centered around the platform's development and integration (Macro-Category A). There are no explicit tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or data engineering for AI models (Macro-Category B). Therefore, the role is classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."
    },
    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software development and integration tasks, and the interaction with ML features. However, it lacks specific details about the ML technologies or the depth of AI involvement beyond 'adding features'. This leaves some room for interpretation, hence a score of 4."
