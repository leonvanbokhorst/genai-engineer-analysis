        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on leading the development of an 'AI-powered' platform, which falls under Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration). While it mentions AI, it doesn't detail specific AI/ML model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG tasks (Macro-Category B). The emphasis is on building and leading the software product that incorporates AI, rather than the AI models themselves. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is clear about the leadership and development aspects of an AI-powered product. However, it lacks specific details about the AI technologies or models involved, making it impossible to classify any tasks under Macro-Category B. This lack of technical AI specificity prevents a perfect score."
