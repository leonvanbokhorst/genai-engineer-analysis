Software Development & Integration`. While 'generative AI' is mentioned as a technical area for training, there are no explicit tasks described that involve building, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or integrating generative AI models into the product. The role's primary responsibilities are rooted in Macro-Category A, with no tasks from Macro-Category B. Therefore, it aligns with the `Software Engineer` profile, which is for roles exclusively in Macro-Category A without AI/ML integration, even if AI is a learning opportunity."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines core software engineering responsibilities. However, the mention of 'generative AI' as a training area, rather than a direct job task, introduces a slight ambiguity about potential future involvement. The confidence is high because the explicit tasks are clearly categorized, but not a perfect 5 due to this indirect mention of AI."
