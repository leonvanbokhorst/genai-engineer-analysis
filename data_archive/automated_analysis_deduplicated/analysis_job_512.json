While 'MLOps' is mentioned, the core tasks described lean towards software engineering and integration (Macro-Category A) rather than deep model development or GenAI specialization (Macro-Category B). The role is about building and deploying solutions that are data-driven, implying the use of ML/AI, but the emphasis is on the engineering and operational aspects of these solutions within a broader organizational context. There is no specific mention of Generative AI tasks like LLMs, RAG, or prompt engineering, nor traditional ML model development. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile as it involves building and integrating AI/ML features into a product/system, but the primary focus is on the engineering and operationalization."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 3,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is somewhat vague regarding specific AI/ML tasks. While 'MLOps' and 'data-driven solutions' are mentioned, there's a lack of detail about the specific models, frameworks, or types of AI/ML being used. The focus is more on the engineering and implementation aspects within a business context. This makes it harder to definitively classify the depth of AI involvement, leading to a moderate confidence score."
