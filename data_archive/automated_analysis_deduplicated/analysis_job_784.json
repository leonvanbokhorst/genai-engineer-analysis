While it mentions advising on generative AI and business rule engines, these are advisory roles rather than hands-on development or specialization in AI/ML model building. The primary output of the role is data-driven solutions and reports, not AI models themselves. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

The role is primarily focused on data engineering and IT solutions, making the classification straightforward. A slightly lower score is given because the depth of involvement with AI technologies is not explicitly detailed beyond advisory capacity."
