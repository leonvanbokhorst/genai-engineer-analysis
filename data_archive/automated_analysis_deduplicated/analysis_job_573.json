While it mentions 'GenAI Copywriting Assistant' as one of the solutions to be developed, the core responsibilities and the majority of the listed technologies are related to general software engineering and CRM development rather than deep AI/ML model development or specialized GenAI tasks. The role integrates AI features into a product but is not primarily focused on the AI/ML aspects themselves. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

The mention of 'GenAI Copywriting Assistant' is present but not the sole focus, allowing for a confident classification as AI-Adjacent. However, the depth of AI involvement is not as extensive as a Core GenAI Engineer role, hence not a perfect 5."
