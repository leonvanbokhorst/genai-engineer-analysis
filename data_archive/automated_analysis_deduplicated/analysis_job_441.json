The tasks involve implementing AI to enhance software development processes, feature development, and problem-solving, rather than deep model development or specialization in GenAI techniques themselves. While 'AI-generated summaries' hints at GenAI capabilities, the overall framing is about integrating AI into existing software engineering practices to improve them. There's no mention of specific GenAI models, frameworks, or deep ML tasks, reinforcing the 'AI-Adjacent' classification."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly positions the role as a software engineer who uses AI as a tool to enhance their work. The tasks described are primarily focused on software development and integration, with AI playing a supporting or enhancing role. The language is generally clear, though it uses more evocative terms like 'superhero status' and 'co-pilot'. The absence of specific AI/ML technologies or deep model-building tasks makes the classification straightforward."
