Phrases like 'help train generative artificial intelligence models', 'engaging with these models as they learn to code', 'Crafting and answering questions related to computer science in order to help train AI models', and 'Evaluating and ranking code generated by AI models' all fall under Macro-Category B: GenAI Specialization. There are no tasks mentioned that fall under Macro-Category A: Core Software Engineering. Therefore, the role is predominantly focused on AI specialization, fitting the 'ML Specialist (Data Scientist)' profile, with a specific emphasis on generative AI tasks."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines tasks related to training and evaluating AI models. However, it lacks specific technical details about the models or the exact methodologies used, and it doesn't mention any core software engineering tasks. The profile assignment is strongly supported by the task descriptions, but the absence of specific tools or broader software engineering context prevents a perfect score."
