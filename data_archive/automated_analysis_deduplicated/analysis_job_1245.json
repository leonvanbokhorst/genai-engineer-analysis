While it mentions the use of Generative AI and Prompt Engineering for specific tasks like test design (Macro-Category B), the primary focus remains on the software engineering aspect of quality assurance. The role is about integrating AI tools into existing quality engineering processes rather than developing AI models themselves. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

The primary responsibilities are rooted in software quality assurance, with AI being an enhancement to those processes. The distinction between this role and a core AI/ML role is clear. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the specific application of GenAI is within a specialized domain (testing) rather than broad AI development."
