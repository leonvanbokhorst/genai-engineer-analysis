While it mentions 'AI messaging systems' and being in the 'AI industry', the core responsibilities and tasks described do not involve the development, fine-tuning, or specific application of AI/ML models themselves. The role is about building the infrastructure that might support AI, rather than building the AI components. Therefore, it fits the 'Software Engineer' profile, which is exclusively focused on Macro-Category A tasks without AI/ML model integration."

However, the mention of 'AI messaging systems' and 'AI industry' is somewhat vague regarding the specific AI/ML tasks involved. While the core tasks are clearly software engineering, the exact nature of the AI integration is not detailed enough to definitively rule out a more AI-adjacent role without further context. The confidence is high but not perfect due to this slight ambiguity."
