The role also includes traditional software engineering tasks like maintaining and extending a search back-end (1.A.1), designing/evaluating AB-tests (1.A.1), and operational responsibilities (1.A.2). The blend of core software engineering (Macro-Category A) and specific GenAI tasks (Macro-Category B) with a clear mention of RAG, points to a 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile."

The confidence is high, but not perfect, as the emphasis on 'search engine' might imply a broader scope than just GenAI, though RAG is explicitly mentioned."
