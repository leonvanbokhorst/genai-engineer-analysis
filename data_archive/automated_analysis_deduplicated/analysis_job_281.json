Specifically, it mentions 'Generative AI' projects like 'GenAI Suite' and 'Klus Coach' (a generative AI assistant), which are central to the GenAI Engineer profile. The role also involves data engineering (Snowflake, Dataiku) and supporting data science initiatives, indicating a strong technical foundation with a clear focus on generative AI applications."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to both data engineering/infrastructure and generative AI projects. The mention of specific generative AI applications (GenAI Suite, Klus Coach) strongly points towards the 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the exact nature of the 'GenAI Suite' and 'Klus Coach' (e.g., whether they involve deep model training or primarily prompt engineering/integration) is not detailed, and the 'data pipelines' and 'Dataiku' aspects lean towards data engineering, which is a strong component but not exclusively GenAI."
