While AI is mentioned as a tool to accelerate delivery, the core responsibilities do not involve building or specializing in AI/ML models themselves. The role is about integrating AI into existing BI solutions rather than developing AI capabilities. Therefore, it aligns best with the 'Software Engineer' profile."

The mention of AI is in the context of accelerating existing BI solutions, not as a core development focus. This clarity allows for a confident assignment to the 'Software Engineer' profile, though the specific mention of AI prevents a perfect score."
