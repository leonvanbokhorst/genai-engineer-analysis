While AI is mentioned as a tool to enhance these tasks and modernize products, there are no specific tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG systems (Macro-Category B). The role is about integrating AI into existing software products rather than building AI models themselves. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

        "reasoning": "The job advertisement is very clear about the nature of the role, focusing on software engineering with AI as an enhancement tool. The responsibilities listed align well with the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile, and there is a distinct lack of emphasis on core AI/ML model development tasks. The distinction between using AI tools and building AI models is clear in the description."
