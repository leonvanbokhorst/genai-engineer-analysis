                "phrase": "Configuring reusable template elements, called AI Controllers in several tools, most notably in ComfyUI",
                "justification": "While not explicitly mentioning 'prompts', configuring 'AI Controllers' in tools like ComfyUI (a popular node-based GUI for Stable Diffusion) implies defining how the generative model should behave and what inputs it should receive, which is a form of controlling or guiding the model's output, aligning with the spirit of prompt engineering."

                "justification": "This involves creating and preparing specific data elements (depth-maps, retouched elements, segmenters, refiners) that are used to control or enhance the AI's output, fitting the definition of data preparation and management for AI models."

        "rationale": "The job advertisement focuses heavily on tasks related to generative AI, specifically mentioning ComfyUI, LoRas, and the creation of elements for controlling AI image generation. The tasks described fall under Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization), with no mention of traditional software engineering tasks from Macro-Category A. Therefore, the profile is 'GenAI Specialist'."
    },
    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite specific about the tools and tasks involved in generative AI, particularly in the context of image generation. However, it lacks detail on the broader software engineering aspects (like deployment, integration into larger systems, or MLOps) that would be expected for a 'Core GenAI Engineer'. The absence of any Macro-Category A tasks leads to a strong classification as 'GenAI Specialist', but the limited scope of the ad prevents a perfect score."
