        "rationale": "The job ad emphasizes the deployment and scaling of existing LLM-based AI solutions ('deploy/roll out the AI solutions of your colleagues', 'further scale these applications') and the building of new AI solutions, which points to both software engineering (1.A.1, 1.A.2) and AI development (1.B.1). The mention of LLMs specifically indicates a Generative AI focus. While there's a strong emphasis on deployment and operations (1.A.1, 1.A.2), the role also involves building new AI solutions (1.B.1) and contributing to innovation (3.5), suggesting a balanced mix of software engineering and AI specialization. The tasks are not exclusively focused on traditional ML, nor are they purely about integrating AI into existing software without developing the AI itself. Therefore, 'Core GenAI Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly indicates a focus on AI solutions, specifically mentioning LLMs, and outlines responsibilities related to deployment, scaling, and building new AI applications. It also touches upon cloud architecture and innovation. While it doesn't list specific technologies, the core tasks align well with the 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as there's no explicit mention of prompt engineering or RAG, which are key GenAI specializations, and the 'building new AI solutions' could be interpreted broadly."
