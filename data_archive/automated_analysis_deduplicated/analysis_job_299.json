        "rationale": "The job advertisement focuses exclusively on tasks related to training, evaluating, and crafting data for AI models, specifically generative AI models. These tasks fall under Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization), with a strong emphasis on 'Model Development & Fine-Tuning' (1.B.1). There are no tasks mentioned that fall under Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering), such as software development, integration, or MLOps. The role is described as a 'Big Data Engineer for AI Training' and involves engaging with models as they learn to code, which aligns with a specialist role focused on the AI model lifecycle rather than software engineering that integrates AI into products. While it mentions 'generative AI', the core tasks are about the training and evaluation process itself, not building applications around these models. Therefore, 'ML Specialist (Data Scientist)' is the most fitting profile, as the role is specialized in the AI model development and training aspects, even though the models are generative."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is clear about the core tasks (training, evaluating AI models) and the domain (generative AI). However, it is light on specific technologies and the 'Big Data Engineer' title might be slightly misleading given the described tasks are more aligned with model training data preparation and evaluation rather than traditional big data engineering. The absence of any software engineering tasks (Macro-Category A) strongly points towards a specialist role."
