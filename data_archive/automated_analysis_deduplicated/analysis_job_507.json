While it mentions GCP native ML solutions and Vertex AI Search/Conversation API (Macro-Category B tasks), the core focus appears to be on integrating these AI technologies into broader cloud solutions and infrastructure rather than deep model development or specialized GenAI tasks. The role is about building and deploying the systems that *use* AI, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

However, it's not overly detailed on the specific AI tasks themselves, leading to a slightly less than perfect confidence score. The distinction between 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' and 'Core GenAI Engineer' is clear based on the emphasis."
