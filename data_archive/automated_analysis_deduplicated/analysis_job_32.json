                "justification": "This phrase describes the creation and provision of a platform, which is a core software engineering activity. The mention of 'data science platform' indicates it's for a specific technical domain, but the act of development and making it usable by others falls under software development and integration."

                "justification": "This phrase directly relates to enabling and assisting data scientists in their work, which involves the data and experimentation aspects crucial for AI development. While not directly building models, supporting their development implies involvement with the data and experimental setup."

        "rationale": "The job ad focuses on the 'Development of a data science platform' (1.A.1) and 'Supporting our data scientists in the development of AI use cases & Experiments' (1.B.3). The primary task is building a platform, which is a software engineering responsibility, and the support for AI use cases is secondary and framed as enabling others. The role does not indicate direct model development or GenAI specialization. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer who builds or maintains software that supports AI/ML, rather than directly developing AI models themselves."
    },
    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is reasonably clear about the core responsibilities, particularly the development of a data science platform. However, the 'supporting data scientists' part is a bit vague regarding the depth of AI/ML involvement. It doesn't explicitly mention GenAI, but the context of 'AI use cases' is present. The confidence is high but not perfect due to the slight ambiguity in the extent of AI/ML task involvement."
