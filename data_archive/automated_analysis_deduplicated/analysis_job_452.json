        "rationale": "The job ad focuses on implementing a product using LLM services for search and text summarization (1.B.2), which is a core GenAI task. It also includes significant software engineering responsibilities like architecture design, scalable code maintenance, and integration into production (1.A.1), as well as MLOps for service monitoring (1.A.2). The role requires collaboration to translate business needs into LLM solutions (1.C.1, 3.1). The balance of GenAI-specific tasks with strong software engineering and operational components, centered around LLMs, points to the 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the tasks involved, specifically mentioning LLM services and product implementation. The software engineering and operational aspects are also well-defined. The only reason it's not a 5 is the absence of specific technology mentions, which would have further solidified the classification. However, the task descriptions are strong indicators."
