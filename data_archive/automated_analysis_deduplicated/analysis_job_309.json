The role involves creating questions for AI training and evaluating AI-generated code, which are specific to the GenAI domain. While it mentions 'software-engineer' in the introduction, the described tasks are specialized for AI model interaction and improvement, not general software development or integration."

However, the initial mention of 'software-engineer' could be slightly misleading if not for the detailed breakdown of tasks that clearly point towards a specialized AI role rather than a general software engineering one. The absence of any Macro-Category A tasks makes the 'GenAI Specialist' profile quite certain."
