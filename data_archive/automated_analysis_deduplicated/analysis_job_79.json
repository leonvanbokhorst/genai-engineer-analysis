        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on traditional software development tasks such as building products from scratch, developing prototypes, backend and API development, and iterative improvement. While it mentions leveraging generative AI and conversational agents, the core responsibilities described are centered around integrating these technologies into a user-friendly product. There is no mention of model development, fine-tuning, or deep technical work with the AI models themselves, nor specific GenAI frameworks. The role is primarily about building software that *uses* GenAI, rather than specializing in the AI models themselves."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software development responsibilities and mentions the use of generative AI. The distinction between building software that *uses* AI versus specializing in AI models is evident. However, the ad is not extremely detailed on the specific AI technologies or frameworks, which prevents a perfect score. The profile assignment is strongly supported by the emphasis on software engineering tasks."
