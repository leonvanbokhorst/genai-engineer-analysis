Therefore, the role is classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly states the role is a 'Senior Front-End Engineer' and the primary task is to 'develop the frontend'. It also explicitly mentions the use of 'generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs)' as technologies being leveraged by the product. While it mentions AI, the core responsibility remains front-end development, fitting the AI-Adjacent profile well. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as there's no explicit mention of the specific programming language or other front-end specific technologies, and the depth of AI involvement is implied rather than detailed."
