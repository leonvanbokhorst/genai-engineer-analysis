        "rationale": "The job primarily focuses on integrating AI capabilities into customer support systems and improving existing AI systems through feedback and fine-tuning. While there's an element of AI improvement (1.B.1), the core function is to integrate and support these AI systems within a broader customer resolution context (1.A.1). There's no indication of developing novel AI models from scratch or deep specialization in GenAI techniques beyond improving existing AI. The role is more about leveraging and enhancing AI within a software/support framework rather than core AI research or development."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to AI integration and improvement within a support context. However, it lacks specific technical tool mentions and the distinction between 'improving the AI system' and 'fine-tuning' could be slightly more explicit to definitively rule out a 'GenAI Specialist' if the focus was purely on model mechanics. The profile assignment is strong based on the described tasks."
