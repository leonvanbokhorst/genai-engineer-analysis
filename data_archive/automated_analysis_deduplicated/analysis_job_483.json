        "rationale": "The job advertisement consists solely of a title (\"Software Engineer - Cyber Defense\") and provides no descriptive text regarding job tasks, responsibilities, or required technologies. Consequently, it is impossible to map any information to the categories defined in the `CODING_BOOK.md`, which are focused on AI/ML roles. Therefore, the role is classified as `Not Relevant` due to insufficient data for analysis within the scope of the coding book."
