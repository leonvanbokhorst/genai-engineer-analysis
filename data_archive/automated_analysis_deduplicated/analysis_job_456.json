        "rationale": "The job advertisement focuses heavily on software engineering tasks such as Spark programming, integrating with cloud ecosystems and third-party applications, and authoring technical documentation (reference architectures, how-tos, demo applications). While it mentions 'Data Science/ML, Cloud' in the title, the core responsibilities described are centered around the application and demonstration of a data platform (Databricks) to solve customer data challenges, rather than the development or fine-tuning of AI/ML models themselves. There are no explicit mentions of Generative AI tasks like prompt engineering, RAG, or model training/fine-tuning. The role is about enabling customers to use the platform effectively, which is a form of integrating AI/ML capabilities into a product/service context. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to software integration and customer-facing technical value demonstration. However, the mention of 'Data Science/ML' in the title could imply some deeper ML involvement than the described tasks suggest, creating a slight ambiguity. The absence of any specific AI/ML model development or GenAI tasks makes the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile the most likely, but a more explicit description of the AI/ML components would increase confidence."
