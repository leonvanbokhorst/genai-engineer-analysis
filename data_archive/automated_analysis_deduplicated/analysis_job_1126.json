        "rationale": "The job primarily focuses on software engineering tasks (1.A.1) such as integrating AI into customer resolution systems, prototyping, and improving AI systems based on human feedback. While there is mention of AI model fine-tuning (1.B.1), the core responsibility is the application and integration of AI into existing support workflows rather than deep model development or specialization. The soft skills emphasize rapid learning and self-sufficient problem-solving, typical of an engineering role. Therefore, the role is classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities that fall into software development and integration, with a secondary focus on AI improvement. The distinction between core AI development and integration is evident. The soft skills are also clearly stated. The confidence is high, but not perfect, as the term 'fine-tuning' could imply deeper ML work, but the overall context leans towards integration."
