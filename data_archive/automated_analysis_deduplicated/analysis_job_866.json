Tasks include architecting and deploying AI products, leading integration initiatives, and applying AI expertise to optimize processes. While there's a strong software engineering component (1.A.1), the core focus is on the application and development of GenAI models (1.B.1) rather than traditional ML. The role requires a 'visionary' and 'innovator' to 'pioneer transformative AI solutions' and 'push the boundaries', indicating a deep engagement with GenAI specialization. The absence of specific traditional ML tasks and the explicit focus on LLMs and 'cutting-edge Generative AI' point towards the 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile."
