While it mentions 'Data Science, Data Engineering and Machine Learning Engineering domains', it does not specify any tasks related to building, fine-tuning, or deploying generative AI models (like LLMs, RAG, prompt engineering) or traditional ML models. The role is primarily about leading and guiding engineering efforts within a data context, rather than specializing in AI/ML model development itself. Therefore, it aligns best with the 'Software Engineer' profile, specifically a senior or principal role with architectural responsibilities."

However, it lacks specific details about the AI/ML technologies or models being worked with, making it impossible to classify it as an AI-focused role. The confidence is high for the 'Software Engineer' classification but would be lower if trying to pinpoint a more specific AI/ML specialization."
