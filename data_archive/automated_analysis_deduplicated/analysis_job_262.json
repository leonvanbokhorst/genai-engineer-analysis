        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on traditional software engineering tasks such as developing backend services, cloud infrastructure, REST APIs, CI/CD pipelines, and ensuring system reliability and security. While it mentions integrating AI models into customer workflows and working with ML engineers, the core responsibilities and tasks described fall under Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering). There are no specific tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). Therefore, the role is classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, as it builds software that integrates AI but does not focus on the AI model development itself."
