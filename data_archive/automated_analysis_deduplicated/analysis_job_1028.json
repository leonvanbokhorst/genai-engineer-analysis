The technologies listed are a blend of general software development tools and specific GenAI tools, indicating a role that builds AI-centric products.

The profile assignment is strongly supported by the listed tasks and technologies. A slightly lower score is given because the 'AI/ML software engineering' knowledge is mentioned as 'some knowledge', which could imply a less deep specialization in AI/ML compared to a pure ML Engineer, but the explicit mention of RAG, Agents, and LLM utilization solidifies the GenAI aspect."
