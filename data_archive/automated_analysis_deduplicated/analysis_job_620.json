While it mentions 'AI solutions', there is no specific mention of Generative AI, LLMs, RAG, or related technologies. The role also emphasizes software engineering aspects like 'production-grade machine learning code', 'scalability', 'realtime', 'monitoring', 'retraining', and 'tooling and infrastructure'. The balance of traditional ML development and robust software engineering practices, without a GenAI focus, points to a Core ML Engineer profile."
