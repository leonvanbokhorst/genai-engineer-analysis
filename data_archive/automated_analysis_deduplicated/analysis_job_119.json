While it mentions integrating ML models, there is no specific mention of Generative AI tasks like prompt engineering, RAG, or fine-tuning specific GenAI models. The emphasis is on the software development lifecycle and integration, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is clear about its software engineering focus and the integration of ML models. However, it lacks specific details about the *type* of ML models or the depth of ML involvement beyond integration, which prevents a perfect score. It's clearly not a specialist role in either traditional ML or GenAI, but rather a software engineering role with an ML component."
