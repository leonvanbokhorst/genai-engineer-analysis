        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on tasks directly related to training and evaluating generative AI models, specifically in the context of code generation. Phrases like 'helpen geavanceerde generatieve AI-modellen betere code te schrijven' and 'Het evalueren en rangschikken van code die door AI-modellen wordt gegenereerd' clearly indicate a specialization in GenAI tasks (Macro-Category B). There are no explicit mentions of traditional software engineering tasks (Macro-Category A) such as building applications, CI/CD, or MLOps. Therefore, the 'GenAI Specialist' profile is the most appropriate fit."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the core tasks related to AI model training and evaluation, specifically for generative AI. While it mentions 'software-engineer' in the introduction, the detailed responsibilities are all within the GenAI specialization. The lack of explicit software engineering tasks (Macro-Category A) makes the profile assignment clear, but the absence of specific technologies or tools prevents a perfect score."
