        "rationale": "The job description focuses on analyzing, improving, and integrating AI systems within a customer support context. While there's mention of AI model fine-tuning and prototyping (1.B.1), the primary emphasis is on applying human expertise to enhance AI performance and integrating AI capabilities into the support process (1.A.1). The role is about supporting and improving an existing AI system rather than developing novel AI models from scratch or focusing purely on AI research. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile, which involves building or maintaining software that uses AI as a core part of its functionality."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines tasks related to AI system improvement and integration, as well as the need for self-sufficiency and rapid learning. While it mentions 'AI model fine-tuning', the overall context points more towards application support and enhancement rather than deep AI model development. The profile assignment is reasonably confident, but a slightly higher score would be warranted with more explicit details on the 'AI system' being worked on."
