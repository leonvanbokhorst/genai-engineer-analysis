The role also involves collaboration and defining technical specifications (1.A.1), suggesting a balanced mix of software engineering and AI specialization. The mention of prompt flows is a strong indicator for GenAI rather than traditional ML."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is reasonably clear about the core responsibilities, particularly mentioning 'prompt flows' which strongly suggests a GenAI focus. However, it lacks specific technology mentions and the description of 'implementing AI models' could be interpreted broadly. The tasks are clearly defined within the coding book categories, but the overall scope could be slightly more detailed."
