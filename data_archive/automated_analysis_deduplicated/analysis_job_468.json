It does not contain any tasks, responsibilities, or technologies related to Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, or Generative AI, which are the sole focus of the CODING_BOOK.md. Therefore, the role is not relevant to the scope of this analysis."

This makes the classification as 'Not Relevant' unambiguous based on the provided CODING_BOOK.md, which is strictly focused on AI/ML roles. The complete absence of any AI/ML keywords or concepts makes the decision straightforward."
