        "rationale": "The job advertisement focuses heavily on tasks related to training and evaluating generative AI models, specifically those that generate code. While it seeks candidates with a software engineering background, the core responsibilities described (creating/answering questions for training, evaluating AI-generated code, interacting with models during learning) fall predominantly under 1.B.1. Model Development & Fine-Tuning. There are no tasks described that involve building software around AI or integrating AI into existing products (Macro-Category A). Therefore, the role is predominantly focused on AI specialization."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the core tasks related to AI model training and evaluation. However, it doesn't explicitly detail the extent of software engineering tasks (Category A) beyond requiring a background in programming, making the precise balance for a 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile slightly less defined. Nevertheless, the emphasis on AI model interaction and evaluation strongly points to a specialist role."
