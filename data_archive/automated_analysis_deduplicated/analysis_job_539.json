Specifically, it emphasizes designing and maintaining MLOps pipelines, infrastructure automation, CI/CD for ML, and supporting model deployment and monitoring. While it mentions ML libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow, the core responsibilities are about the operationalization and engineering of ML systems rather than the development or fine-tuning of the models themselves (Macro-Category B). There are no explicit mentions of Generative AI tasks or technologies. Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, as it involves building and maintaining the engineering infrastructure for AI/ML models within a software context."
