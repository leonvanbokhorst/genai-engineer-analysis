It also includes integrating these models into existing software solutions (Macro-Category A task). The blend of developing GenAI-specific components and integrating them into broader software systems, with a clear emphasis on GenAI tools, points to the 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly lists specific GenAI technologies and tasks related to developing AI agents and integrating them. The language is direct and provides enough detail to confidently assign a profile. A slightly lower score is given because the 'integration' aspect could be interpreted as more 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' if the GenAI focus was less pronounced, but the explicit mention of GPT, LangChain, and LangGraph solidifies the GenAI core."
