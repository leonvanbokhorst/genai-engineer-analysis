While there's mention of integrating AI into customer products (1.A.1), the core emphasis is on the AI/GenAI specific tasks (1.B.1, 1.B.2). There's a strong component of learning and innovation (3.2, 3.5). The role is not primarily about building traditional software or MLOps, nor is it a balanced mix of deep software engineering and GenAI tasks. Therefore, 'GenAI Specialist' is the most fitting profile."

It specifies the domain (GenAI) and the nature of the work (exploring, iterating, showcasing). However, it lacks specific technical tools or programming languages, and the 'software development & integration' aspects are mentioned but not detailed, making it slightly less definitive than an ad with explicit technical requirements."
