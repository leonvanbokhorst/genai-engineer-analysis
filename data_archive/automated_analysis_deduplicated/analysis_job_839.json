        "rationale": "The job advertisement focuses heavily on building and maintaining data infrastructure, data pipelines, and managing cloud environments (Azure, Kubernetes, Terraform). While it supports AI models by processing data for them, the core responsibilities are centered around software engineering tasks (1.A.1) and MLOps (1.A.2), with a specific emphasis on data engineering (1.B.3). There are no explicit tasks related to developing, fine-tuning, or prompt engineering of generative AI models (Macro-Category B, excluding 1.B.3). The role is about enabling AI through robust data infrastructure, rather than directly building AI models or GenAI applications. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."
