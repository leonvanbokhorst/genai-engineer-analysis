It also heavily emphasizes AI specialization tasks (Macro-Category B), specifically mentioning research, prototyping, and building AI/ML driven systems, understanding video, and explicitly referencing 'Vector databases to LLM's'. This indicates a strong focus on Generative AI technologies. The blend of core software engineering with specific GenAI technologies points to the 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile."

While it doesn't explicitly detail fine-tuning or prompt engineering, the overall emphasis on building AI-driven systems and pushing boundaries in the AI ecosystem strongly suggests a GenAI focus. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as some specific GenAI tasks could be more explicit."
