        "rationale": "The job ad focuses on enhancing user interfaces by integrating AI-driven features. This indicates a primary responsibility in software development (Macro-Category A) with a specific focus on incorporating AI, rather than developing the AI models themselves (Macro-Category B). Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."
