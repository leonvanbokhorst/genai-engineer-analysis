The responsibilities heavily emphasize traditional software engineering tasks like delivering high-quality code, ensuring platform scalability and reliability (1.A.1). It also involves integrating AI features and working with product designers and ML engineers on implementation (1.A.1). While specific GenAI techniques like prompt engineering and embeddings are mentioned (1.B.2, 1.B.3), they are framed as tools to 'develop innovative solutions with generative AI' within the context of the AI platform and features, rather than deep model development or research. There is no significant focus on MLOps (1.A.2) or core ML model development (1.B.1). This distribution, with a strong emphasis on Macro-Category A and specific applications of GenAI, aligns best with the AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."
