The identified tasks ('development of generative AI solutions', 'make information... accessible') are predominantly focused on Generative AI capabilities (Macro-Category B). The snippet does not provide evidence of traditional software engineering tasks (Macro-Category A) or a balanced mix required for a 'Core GenAI Engineer'. Therefore, the role appears to be focused on the specialized application of GenAI."

This makes it difficult to definitively classify the role and its balance between software engineering and AI specialization. The current analysis is based on limited information and interpretations of high-level statements."
