        "rationale": "The job description primarily focuses on 'Designing and building high-quality AI automations' and 'Architecting and deploying sophisticated, fully-automated AI systems' (Macro-Category A tasks). While it mentions experimenting with AI tools like GPT-4 Vision and optimizing AI solutions (which touch upon Macro-Category B), the core emphasis is on integrating these into existing developmental processes and ensuring performance and scalability within applications. The role appears to be about building software that *uses* AI rather than developing the AI models themselves. There's no explicit mention of model training, fine-tuning, or deep ML research, nor specific GenAI frameworks like LangChain or RAG implementation details. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering responsibilities with an AI component. The mention of specific AI tools like GPT-4 Vision and AWS provides good context. However, the depth of AI/ML specific tasks is not extensively detailed, making it slightly less definitive than a role explicitly focused on model development or GenAI specialization. The confidence is high due to the clear software engineering focus."
