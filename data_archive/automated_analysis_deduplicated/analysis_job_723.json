While it mentions 'AI/ML, and Gen AI' and 'data science skills', the core responsibilities are focused on supporting customers in using the platform and integrating it into their workflows. There are no explicit tasks related to developing, fine-tuning, or engineering AI/ML models themselves. The role is primarily about enabling users and ensuring successful integration of the platform's capabilities, which aligns with supporting AI/ML features within a product rather than building them. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines a customer-facing, consultative role focused on platform adoption and enablement. While AI/ML and GenAI are mentioned as areas the platform supports, the core tasks are about customer success and integration, not direct AI model development. The distinction between supporting AI-powered products and building AI models is clear enough to assign a profile with high confidence, though the specific mention of 'data science skills' could imply a slightly deeper technical involvement than a pure software engineer, but not enough to shift to a specialist role."
