As such, it cannot be analyzed against the categories defined in the CODING_BOOK.md, which are focused on AI/ML roles. The 'Not Relevant' profile is assigned because there are no identifiable tasks from either Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering) or Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization)."
