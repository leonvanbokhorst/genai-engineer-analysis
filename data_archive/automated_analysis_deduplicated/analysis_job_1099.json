It explicitly states it's not a traditional engineering role but combines technical work with AI. The distinction between using AI as a tool versus developing AI models is clear. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the specific AI technologies or models are not detailed, and the term 'AI-driven systems' is broad."
