While it mentions using generative AI to improve project delivery and client service, it explicitly states 'Coding or programming' is NOT part of the role. The focus is on leveraging AI as a tool within a consulting framework rather than developing AI models or core AI infrastructure. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile, where AI is integrated into existing processes and client solutions, but the primary function is not software engineering or AI specialization itself."

The emphasis on consulting, client interaction, and leveraging AI as a tool for project delivery provides strong evidence for the profile assignment. The only slight ambiguity is the term 'Implementation Engineer', which could sometimes imply coding, but the explicit exclusion of programming clarifies this."
