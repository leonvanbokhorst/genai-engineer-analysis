While it mentions the integration of generative AI solutions and lists LLMs (OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic) and NLP as a plus, these AI-specific responsibilities are secondary to the core software development duties. The role is primarily about building and enhancing the software platform, which happens to be integrating AI, rather than focusing on the AI models themselves. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

The role is well-defined as a Senior Python Developer who will work with AI, rather than an AI specialist. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the extent of involvement with AI is not deeply detailed beyond 'integrating'."
