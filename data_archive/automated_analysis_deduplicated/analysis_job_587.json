While it mentions 'ML Optimization' and 'Generative AI' as areas of expertise, the core responsibilities described are about building and integrating these solutions into the broader Uber platform, rather than deep model development or specialization in GenAI techniques themselves. The emphasis is on the engineering aspect of delivering AI solutions, fitting the profile of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

However, it doesn't go into deep technical detail about specific ML models or GenAI techniques, which would have elevated the confidence to a 5. The mention of 'Generative AI' as a key area of expertise is present but not elaborated upon in the 'What You'll Do' section."
