While it mentions 'AI-generated summaries' which hints at generative AI, the core focus remains on using AI as a 'co-pilot' and 'booster' within software engineering, rather than specializing in model development or GenAI-specific tasks. The role is about building software that leverages AI, fitting the description of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly positions the role within software engineering, using AI as an enhancement. The tasks are predominantly related to software development and integration, with a specific mention of AI-generated summaries suggesting some GenAI interaction. However, there's no deep dive into specific GenAI models or advanced prompt engineering techniques, making it lean towards AI-adjacent rather than a core GenAI role. The confidence is high due to the clear emphasis on software engineering principles."
