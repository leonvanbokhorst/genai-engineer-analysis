        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on software development tasks (ideate, architect, deploy, design, implement AI-centric/AI-driven Web/Mobile Applications and Tools) which fall under Macro-Category A. While AI is mentioned as a core component of the applications, there are no specific tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). The role involves integrating AI into applications rather than developing the AI models themselves. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software development and integration tasks with an AI focus. However, it lacks specific details about the AI technologies or models to be used, and the 'AI-centric' and 'AI-driven' descriptions are somewhat general. The operational tasks are also present but not deeply detailed. The soft skills are implied through collaboration. The profile assignment is clear based on the emphasis on application development over AI model specifics, but a higher score would require more explicit AI task details."
