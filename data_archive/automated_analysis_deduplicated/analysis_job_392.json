This demonstrates a balanced mix of core software engineering (Macro-Category A) and AI specialization (Macro-Category B), with a clear focus on Generative AI ('generatieve AI services'). This combination aligns with the definition of a Core GenAI Engineer."

The mention of 'generatieve AI services' is specific. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5 due to the brevity and the potential ambiguity in 'ML modellen' which could lean towards traditional ML if not for the 'generative AI services' context."
