        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on integrating ML models into applications and microservices, which falls under Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration). While it mentions ML models, it does not detail tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). The primary emphasis is on the software engineering aspects of deploying and managing ML-integrated systems. The soft skills identified also support a software engineering role. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering tasks related to ML integration and includes specific soft skills. However, it lacks detail on the specific types of ML models or the depth of ML expertise required, making it slightly less definitive than a role explicitly detailing model building or GenAI-specific tasks. The mention of 'Generative AI' in the appended text is noted but not directly tied to the core responsibilities listed."
