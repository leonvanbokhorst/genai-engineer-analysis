While it mentions Generative AI and LLM technologies, the core responsibilities are centered around the engineering and integration of these into cloud platforms and applications (Macro-Category A tasks). There is no explicit mention of model development, fine-tuning, or prompt engineering as primary tasks (Macro-Category B). Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."
