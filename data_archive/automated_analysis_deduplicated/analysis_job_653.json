While AI is mentioned, the core responsibilities are rooted in software engineering and data visualization, with AI serving as an accelerator rather than the central focus of model development or specialization. There are no tasks related to core ML or GenAI model development (Macro-Category B). Therefore, it fits the profile of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

The mention of AI is in the context of accelerating existing BI solutions. While not a deep AI role, the tasks are well-defined within the software engineering and business intelligence domain. The confidence is high, but not perfect, as the specific AI application is described broadly."
