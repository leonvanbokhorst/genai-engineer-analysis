        "rationale": "The job advertisement heavily emphasizes traditional software engineering tasks (development, operations, architecture, integration, code review, testing) within the security domain. While it mentions the 'adoption of ML/GenAI' and tasks related to threat analysis and research that could involve ML/GenAI, these are framed as enhancements to security capabilities rather than the core focus of building generative AI models or applications. The role is primarily about building and securing systems, with AI/ML being a tool or area of application within that broader software engineering context. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."
