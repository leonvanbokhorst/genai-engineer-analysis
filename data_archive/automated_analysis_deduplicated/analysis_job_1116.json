While there's mention of AI model fine-tuning and prototyping, the primary emphasis is on applying and improving AI within a broader application context (customer resolutions), rather than core AI research or development. The role is about supporting and enhancing an AI-augmented system, making 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' the most fitting profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to AI integration and improvement within a support context. The tasks lean towards applying AI rather than deep model building. The 'What you will NOT be doing' section also provides useful context. However, the specific technologies or AI models are not mentioned, and the 'fine-tuning' aspect could be interpreted in different ways, slightly reducing absolute certainty."
