The AI/GenAI aspect is present as the context of the platform, but the tasks themselves are more aligned with software development and integration. The role is not hands-on with AI model development or GenAI specialization. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the 'AI-Adjacent' nature is inferred from the focus on developer tools within an AI platform, rather than direct AI task descriptions."
