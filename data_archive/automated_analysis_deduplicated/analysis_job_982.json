While it mentions 'software engineer' and 'coding expertise', the primary described activity is model development and refinement (1.B.1). There is no mention of software integration into applications (1.A.1), MLOps (1.A.2), prompt engineering (1.B.2), or data engineering (1.B.3). The role is centered on the AI model itself rather than building software around it. Therefore, it leans towards a specialist role focused on the AI model development aspect."

        "score": 3,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite brief and lacks specific details about the day-to-day tasks beyond 'training AI models' and 'lending coding expertise'. While it mentions 'generative AI', it doesn't specify the type of models or the exact nature of the training. The majority of the text is about payment and contract terms, not the core responsibilities. This ambiguity makes it difficult to assign a higher confidence score."
