While it mentions 'Gen AI solutions', the core responsibilities and the title 'Junior Full Stack Engineer' point towards integrating these solutions into broader applications rather than specializing in model development or fine-tuning. The tasks are predominantly from Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration) with a clear application of GenAI within that context."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering responsibilities and mentions GenAI as the domain of application. However, it lacks specific details on the AI/ML tasks themselves, making it lean towards an AI-adjacent role rather than a core AI/ML role. The confidence is high for the classification of tasks but moderate for definitively excluding a deeper AI specialization without more explicit AI-centric task descriptions."
