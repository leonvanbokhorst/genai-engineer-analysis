        "rationale": "The job advertisement focuses heavily on traditional data engineering tasks such as designing, building, and optimizing data pipelines, cleaning, transforming, and aggregating data, and managing data architecture. While it mentions collaboration with data scientists and supporting machine learning through data models and pipelines, there is no mention of generative AI specific tasks (like LLMs, RAG, prompt engineering) or traditional ML model development/fine-tuning. The core responsibilities align with Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering), specifically Data Engineering & Management (1.B.3) and Operations & MLOps (1.A.2), with some elements of Business Understanding (1.C.1). There are no tasks that fall under Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization). Therefore, the role is classified as a 'Software Engineer' with a specialization in data engineering, rather than an AI/ML role."
