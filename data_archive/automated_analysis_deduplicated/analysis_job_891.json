        "rationale": "The job description heavily emphasizes traditional software engineering tasks such as system integration, backend development, architecture restructuring, and API enhancement. While it mentions the use of 'algorithms' for identifying healthcare providers and optimizing processes, this is presented as a feature within the application rather than a deep focus on model development or GenAI specifics. The core responsibilities and technologies (TypeScript, Node.js, React, GraphQL, PostgreSQL, GCP) are all standard software engineering tools. There is no mention of LLMs, prompt engineering, RAG, or specific GenAI frameworks. Therefore, the role is classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer because it involves integrating AI/ML features (algorithms) into a software product, but the primary focus remains on software engineering."

The mention of 'algorithms' is the only AI-related aspect, and it's framed within the context of enhancing existing application functionality rather than core AI/ML research or GenAI development. This clarity allows for a confident classification."
