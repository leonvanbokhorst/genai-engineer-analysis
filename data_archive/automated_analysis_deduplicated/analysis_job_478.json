        "rationale": "The job description emphasizes 'Full Stack Developer AI' and focuses on 'developing Generative AI applications', 'implementing AI applications', and working on 'backend and frontend'. It also mentions setting up 'cloud environments' and contributing to 'strategic objectives' and 'data-driven decision-making'. While AI is central, the core tasks described are software development and integration (Macro-Category A), with a specific application of AI. There is no mention of core model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG implementation (Macro-Category B). The role is about building software that *uses* AI, rather than specializing in the AI models themselves. The mention of coaching also points to a more senior engineering role. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."
    },
    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly states the role is a 'Full Stack Developer AI' and outlines responsibilities that are primarily software engineering focused (backend, frontend, cloud environments) with the integration of Generative AI. The lack of specific AI model development or advanced GenAI techniques (like RAG or fine-tuning) makes the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile quite clear. However, the ad is in Dutch and some nuances might be lost without deeper context, hence not a perfect 5."
