        "rationale": "The job advertisement heavily emphasizes traditional software engineering tasks such as designing, developing, maintaining, integrating, testing, and ensuring the scalability and security of .NET applications. While it mentions AI models and AI specialists, the core responsibility is to integrate these AI models into existing .NET applications and maintain the software itself. There is no indication of developing AI models from scratch, fine-tuning them, or focusing on prompt engineering or RAG. The role is primarily about building software that *uses* AI, rather than building the AI itself. Therefore, it aligns best with the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."
