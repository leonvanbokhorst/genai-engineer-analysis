While AI/ML/GenAI are mentioned as tools for fixing issues, the primary focus appears to be on automation development and maintenance using these tools, rather than core AI model development or GenAI specialization. The tasks lean more towards integrating and managing automated systems that *use* AI, rather than building AI models from scratch or specializing in GenAI concepts. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer role, where AI/ML is a component within a broader automation engineering context."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is clear about the tasks and technologies involved, particularly the use of AI/ML/GenAI in the context of automation. However, the role is an internship, and the specific depth of involvement with GenAI versus traditional automation is not fully detailed, leading to a slightly less than perfect confidence score. The classification of 'AI' and 'Machine learning' as 'Other Technical Skills' is due to the coding book's structure not having a specific category for general AI/ML as a toolset outside of specific model types or frameworks."
