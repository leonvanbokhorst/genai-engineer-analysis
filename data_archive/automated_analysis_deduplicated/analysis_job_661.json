While AI is mentioned, the core tasks are about building and improving systems that *use* AI to enhance customer service, rather than developing the AI models themselves. There are no specific mentions of model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or traditional ML tasks (Macro-Category B). The role also emphasizes business outcomes and team upskilling. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer who builds software that incorporates AI features."

While it mentions AI, it doesn't delve into the specifics of AI model development or deep AI research, making the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile a strong fit. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the ad could have been more explicit about the *type* of AI tools being developed (e.g., LLM-based vs. other ML models), though the context strongly suggests application-level AI integration."
