        "rationale": "The job primarily focuses on integrating AI capabilities into customer support resolutions and improving existing AI systems (Macro-Category A tasks like 'Software Development & Integration' and 'Prompt Engineering & RAG' which is often an integration task). While there's mention of 'AI model fine-tuning', the core responsibility appears to be supporting and enhancing an AI-driven customer resolution process rather than deep model development or specialization. The role is about applying AI to a specific business function (customer support) and improving the system that uses AI, rather than being a pure AI model builder or researcher."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to AI integration and improvement within a customer support context. The distinction between core AI development and applying AI to a business function is reasonably clear. However, the 'fine-tuning' aspect could lean slightly more towards specialization, but the overall emphasis on integration and support makes 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' the most fitting profile. The aggressive ramp-up time and self-sufficiency requirement also provide strong indicators for soft skills."
