        "rationale": "The job description heavily emphasizes data engineering tasks (Macro-Category B, specifically 1.B.3 Data Engineering & Management) such as designing data architectures, building data pipelines, and managing data sources for LLM use cases. It also includes some software development/integration tasks (1.A.1) like implementing access control and contributing to AI assistant development, and operational tasks (1.A.2) related to monitoring data processes. However, there are no tasks related to core model development, fine-tuning, or prompt engineering (Macro-Category B, 1.B.1, 1.B.2). The role is focused on enabling AI applications through robust data infrastructure rather than building the AI models themselves. This aligns best with the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile, which is primarily focused on Macro-Category A but integrates AI/ML features into a product, or in this case, provides the critical data foundation for AI."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to data pipelines, data architecture, and vector databases, which are core to data engineering for AI. The mention of LLM use cases and AI assistants provides context. While it touches on operational and integration aspects, the primary focus remains on data infrastructure. The profile assignment is straightforward based on the dominance of data engineering tasks supporting AI rather than direct AI model development."
