        "rationale": "The job ad explicitly states 'Staff Software Engineer, Backend' and mentions joining an 'ML Platform team'. Crucially, it clarifies that an 'ML background is not required'. This strongly suggests the role is primarily focused on software engineering tasks (Macro-Category A) without a deep requirement for AI/ML specialization (Macro-Category B), fitting the 'Software Engineer' profile."
