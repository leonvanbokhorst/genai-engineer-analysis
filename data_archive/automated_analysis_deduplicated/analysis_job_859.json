The core tasks described are traditional software development and integration (Macro-Category A), with a mention of designing AI-driven solutions which could involve elements of GenAI specialization (Macro-Category B). However, the role is framed around enhancing existing systems and workflows within the Pega platform, rather than deep model development or specialized GenAI research. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile, where software engineering is the primary focus, augmented by the integration of AI features."

The responsibilities are well-defined within the context of software development and enhancement. While the 'AI-driven case management solutions' could be interpreted in multiple ways, the overall emphasis remains on application development and integration, making the profile assignment reasonably confident. A slightly lower score is given because the specific nature of the 'GenAI' work within Pega isn't deeply detailed, leaving some room for interpretation."
