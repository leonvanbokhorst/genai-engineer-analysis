        "rationale": "The job ad emphasizes the use of generative AI to enhance project delivery and client services, which are primarily software engineering tasks (Macro-Category A). While generative AI is mentioned, the core responsibilities revolve around consulting, advising, and configuring within a software platform, rather than developing or fine-tuning AI models themselves (Macro-Category B). The role is about integrating AI into existing consulting workflows and client solutions, fitting the description of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the nature of the role, focusing on consulting and AI-enhanced delivery rather than core AI development. However, it explicitly states 'Coding or programming' is NOT part of the role, which slightly shifts the emphasis away from traditional software engineering and more towards a consultative, AI-leveraging role. The classification as AI-Adjacent Software Engineer is strong, but the absence of explicit coding tasks makes it not a perfect 5."
