        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on 'machine learning models and algorithms', 'translating complex datasets into actionable insights', and 'enhancing performance and scalability of machine learning systems'. While it mentions '(gen)AI capabilities', the core tasks described lean towards traditional ML development and optimization rather than specific Generative AI tasks like prompt engineering or RAG. The integration into the product suite (1.A.1) and operational enhancement (1.A.2) are present but secondary to the core ML model development (1.B.1). Therefore, 'Core ML Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to ML model development, data insights, integration, and system optimization. It uses specific terminology that allows for clear categorization. However, the mention of '(gen)AI' is somewhat ambiguous, and the absence of specific GenAI tools or tasks prevents a definitive classification as 'Core GenAI Engineer'. The confidence is high for identifying it as a core ML role, but not absolute for the GenAI aspect."
