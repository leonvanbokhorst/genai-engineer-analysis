There's also a task related to converting PoCs to production-ready solutions with data scientists (1.B.1). The emphasis on MLOps and LLM services, combined with the collaborative aspect with data scientists and ITOps, points towards a balanced role that integrates GenAI capabilities within an operational framework. While not explicitly building models from scratch, the focus on LLM services and productionizing solutions with data scientists leans towards a GenAI Engineer profile."

The tasks are specific enough to categorize, but the exact nature of 'LLM Services toevoegen' could be interpreted in various ways (e.g., integrating existing APIs vs. fine-tuning). The profile assignment is strong, but a slightly higher confidence would require more explicit detail on the GenAI model development or prompt engineering aspects."
