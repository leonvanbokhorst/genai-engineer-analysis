        "rationale": "The job ad focuses exclusively on tasks related to training and evaluating AI models, specifically generative AI models. The core activities described, such as crafting questions for training and evaluating generated code, fall under 'Model Development & Fine-Tuning' (1.B.1). There are no tasks related to software development, integration, or MLOps (Macro-Category A). While the role mentions 'software engineer' in the introductory sentence, the detailed responsibilities are centered on the AI model training process itself, making it a specialist role in this area."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines tasks related to AI model training and evaluation. However, it is brief and lacks detail on specific technologies or the broader software engineering context that might be expected for other profiles. The mention of 'software engineer' in the introduction could be slightly misleading if interpreted as a traditional software engineering role, but the detailed tasks clarify the focus. The confidence is high because the core tasks are clearly defined within the AI Specialization category."
