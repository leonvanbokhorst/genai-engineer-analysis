        "rationale": "The job ad focuses on traditional machine learning tasks such as 'statistical models and predictive algorithms' (1.B.1). While it mentions developing 'end-to-end solutions' and 'robust solutions that are used in production' (1.A.1, 1.A.2), indicating software engineering aspects, the core emphasis is on the ML model development itself. There is no mention of Generative AI specific technologies like LLMs, RAG, or related frameworks. The role also involves understanding client needs and creating impact (1.C.1), and collaboration (3.1). Given the strong focus on traditional ML tasks and the absence of GenAI specifics, the 'Core ML Engineer' profile is the most appropriate."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the core tasks involving traditional ML models and operationalization. However, it lacks specific technology mentions, which would have further solidified the classification. The absence of any GenAI keywords makes the distinction from a GenAI role clear, but the exact balance between ML specialization and software engineering is slightly less detailed than in some other ads."
