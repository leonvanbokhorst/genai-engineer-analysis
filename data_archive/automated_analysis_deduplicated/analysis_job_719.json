The core tasks involve client interaction, authoring reference architectures, and hands-on programming to showcase the platform's value. While a background in Data Science/ML/GenAI is required, the role's primary responsibilities fall under Macro-Category A: Core Software Engineering (specifically 1.A.1. Software Development & Integration), as the engineer is showcasing and integrating existing AI/ML-powered solutions rather than developing or fine-tuning models themselves. This aligns with the AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

The distinction between performing AI/ML tasks versus demonstrating AI/ML-enabled products is clear. The only slight ambiguity is how much 'hands-on evaluation' might involve deep technical AI/ML work versus platform feature demonstration, but the overall context strongly favors the pre-sales/integration aspect."
