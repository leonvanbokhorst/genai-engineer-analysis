        "rationale": "The job ad focuses entirely on tasks related to training and evaluating generative AI models (specifically LLMs that write code). While it mentions 'experienced software engineer', the core responsibilities described (crafting questions for training, evaluating AI-generated code) fall squarely under AI Specialization (Macro-Category B) and specifically GenAI tasks (1.B.1). There are no tasks related to traditional software development (Macro-Category A). Therefore, the 'GenAI Specialist' profile is the most appropriate."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines tasks related to training and evaluating AI models, specifically generative AI. However, it lacks detail on specific technologies or the depth of involvement in model development beyond data annotation/evaluation. The mention of 'experienced software engineer' could imply some integration tasks, but the described tasks are primarily focused on the AI model's learning process. The confidence is high for the task classification but moderate for the profile due to the limited scope of the description."
