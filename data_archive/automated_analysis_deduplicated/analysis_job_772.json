It also includes developing and integrating AI models into cloud solutions (1.A.1 and 1.B.1). While there's mention of developing new AI models and solutions, the primary focus and title ('DevOps Engineer') lean towards enabling and supporting the deployment and operation of AI, rather than deep model research or specialized GenAI application building. The role is about building and maintaining the systems that host and deploy AI, making it an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer role."

The title 'DevOps Engineer' strongly suggests the primary focus is on the operational aspects. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the description of 'develop new models and solutions' could imply a deeper involvement in model creation than a typical DevOps role, though the overall context points to an adjacent role."
