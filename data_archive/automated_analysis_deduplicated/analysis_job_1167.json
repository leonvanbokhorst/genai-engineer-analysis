While it mentions GenAI technologies like LLMs and GPT-4 Vision, the core focus is on integrating these into existing systems and providing support for their use within workflows. The role is about building and supporting AI-powered features rather than deep model development or specialized GenAI research. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile, where the primary responsibility is software engineering augmented by AI integration."

The mention of specific AI technologies is present but the emphasis remains on the engineering and support aspects of integrating them into platforms. The profile assignment is straightforward based on this emphasis. A slightly lower score is given because the role is described as 'Support Engineer', which could imply a more reactive role, but the tasks listed are proactive development and integration."
