        "rationale": "The job ad emphasizes both traditional ML tasks such as deploying production-ready ML models and exploring ML research (1.B.1), alongside core software engineering responsibilities like deploying pipelines on the cloud and ensuring project delivery (1.A.1). The role also includes significant client-facing and internal guidance aspects (3.1, 1.C.1). While it mentions 'ML Engineer' and 'ML research', there is no explicit mention of Generative AI specific tasks or technologies. Therefore, it aligns best with a 'Core ML Engineer' profile."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the responsibilities, mentioning both ML-specific tasks and software engineering practices. The absence of any Generative AI specific terms makes the classification towards 'Core ML Engineer' straightforward. A perfect score is not given as the ad could be more explicit about the types of ML models or research areas."
