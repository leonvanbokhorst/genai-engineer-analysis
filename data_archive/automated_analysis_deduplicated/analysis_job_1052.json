While it mentions integrating AI models, the core responsibility is building and connecting applications rather than developing or fine-tuning AI models themselves (Macro-Category B). The role does not appear to require deep AI/ML expertise but rather the application of AI within a software development context. Therefore, it aligns best with the 'Software Engineer' profile, which is characterized by tasks exclusively from Macro-Category A, even when those tasks involve integrating AI."

The primary tasks fall squarely into software development and integration. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the term 'AI-modellen' is broad and could imply a deeper involvement than explicitly stated, though the overall context points to integration."
