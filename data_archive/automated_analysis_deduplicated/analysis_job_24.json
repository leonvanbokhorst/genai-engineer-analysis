While it mentions collaboration and business optimization (1.C.1), the explicit mention of LLM development and prompt engineering, combined with data handling, points towards a role that balances software engineering principles with specialized GenAI tasks. The role is not purely a specialist as it involves pipeline development and collaboration, nor is it purely AI-adjacent as the core task involves developing LLM applications. Therefore, 'Core GenAI Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to data pipelines, data transformation, prompt engineering with LLMs, and collaboration. The mention of 'LLM models' and 'Prompt engineering' is specific. However, the ad is for a 'Marketing Data Analyst / Engineer', which might imply a broader scope than a pure GenAI Engineer, and some tasks like 'Data Governance' could be interpreted in different ways. The confidence is high but not perfect due to the hybrid nature of the title and potential for broader data analysis tasks."
