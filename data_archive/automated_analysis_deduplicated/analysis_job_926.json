        "rationale": "The job advertisement is extremely brief, providing only the title 'Senior Data Engineer'. There is no information about specific tasks, technologies, or soft skills. Data engineering roles typically involve building and managing data infrastructure and pipelines, which fall under `Macro-Category A: Core Software Engineering`. Since the advertisement does not mention any AI or ML components, and the `Software Engineer` profile is defined as having tasks exclusively from `Macro-Category A` and not involving AI/ML integration, this profile is assigned as the most fitting general classification in the absence of specific AI/ML context. However, this assignment is highly speculative due to the lack of detailed information."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 1,
        "reasoning": "The job advertisement is too minimal, containing only the job title. This provides no actionable information to perform a detailed analysis according to the `CODING_BOOK.md`'s categories for tasks, technologies, or soft skills. The profile assignment is therefore a highly speculative interpretation based on the general understanding of the job title, rather than concrete evidence from the ad."
