While it mentions 'generative AI in risk summarization' as a product supported by INGA, the responsibilities of the Data Engineer role itself are centered on the data infrastructure and pipelines that enable these AI initiatives, rather than directly developing or fine-tuning AI models. The tasks are predominantly software engineering focused, with the AI aspect being a downstream consumer of the data solutions provided. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

While it mentions AI initiatives within the broader department, the specific role's tasks are primarily software engineering. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, because the mention of 'generative AI in risk summarization' could imply a deeper involvement with AI than the core responsibilities suggest, though the detailed tasks lean heavily towards data engineering."
