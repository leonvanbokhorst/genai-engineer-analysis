The responsibilities are overwhelmingly focused on core software engineering tasks (Macro-Category A), such as guiding development, integration across platforms, architecture and design, code quality, and overseeing the development lifecycle. While AI is the domain, there are no explicit tasks related to AI model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or specialized AI data engineering (Macro-Category B). The role involves building and leading software systems that utilize AI, rather than developing the AI models themselves, which fits the definition of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."
