        "rationale": "The job description heavily emphasizes traditional software engineering tasks such as designing, developing, deploying, testing, and optimizing full-stack solutions. While it mentions integrating 'AI capabilities' and staying updated with 'AI technologies', it does not detail specific AI model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG tasks. The core focus remains on building software that *uses* AI, rather than specializing in the AI models themselves. Therefore, the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile is the most fitting."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering responsibilities and the integration of AI features. However, it lacks specific details about the AI technologies or models to be used, making it slightly less definitive than a role that explicitly mentions LLMs, RAG, or specific model training. The confidence is high because the software engineering aspects are very clear."
