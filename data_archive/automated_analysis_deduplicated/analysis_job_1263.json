While it mentions research into GenAI products (1.B.1) and providing technical guidance (1.C.1), the core focus is on developing and implementing AI solutions for customer projects and integrating them into existing offerings. There's no explicit mention of deep model development, fine-tuning, or specific GenAI frameworks like LangChain, nor is there a strong emphasis on traditional ML tasks. The role appears to be about applying AI, particularly GenAI, within a software development context for clients."

The mention of 'Google Cloud's GenAI platform' provides some context, but specific technologies or deep AI/ML tasks are not detailed. The profile assignment is strong, but a higher score would require more explicit technical details about the AI/ML components being developed or integrated."
