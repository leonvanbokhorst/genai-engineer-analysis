While it mentions AI concepts like LLMs, embeddings, and vector databases, the core focus remains on the software development and integration aspect (Macro-Category A), with AI being a feature to be integrated rather than the primary focus of model development or specialization (Macro-Category B). The role is described as a 'junior AI engineer' within a 'Generative AI team', but the described tasks lean heavily towards engineering the AI platform and integrating AI into products, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the primary responsibilities related to software development and integration within an AI context. It specifies the technology stack (Python) and mentions AI concepts, but the emphasis is on building and providing services for AI adoption rather than deep AI model development. The 'junior' aspect and the mention of a 'Young Professional Program' also provide context. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the exact balance between pure software engineering and AI specialization could be slightly more explicit."
