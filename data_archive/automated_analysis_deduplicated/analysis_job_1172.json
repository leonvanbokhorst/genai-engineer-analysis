While there are software engineering tasks (building data pipelines, web applications, MLOps platform, integration), the core focus of the model development is on traditional ML, not Generative AI. The distribution of tasks leans towards both software engineering (Macro-Category A) and ML specialization (Macro-Category B), but the specialization is in traditional ML, fitting the 'Core ML Engineer' profile."
