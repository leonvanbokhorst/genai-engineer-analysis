The role is about integrating and optimizing existing customer service tools and processes, with AI being a potential enhancement rather than the core product or task. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile, where AI is used to augment existing software/service functionalities."

The mention of generative AI is in the context of innovation and enhancement of existing processes, rather than core AI development. The role is clearly defined as Customer Success Engineer, which helps in distinguishing it from pure AI engineering roles. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the integration of AI is mentioned as a potential area for innovation, which could be interpreted with slightly varying degrees of depth."
