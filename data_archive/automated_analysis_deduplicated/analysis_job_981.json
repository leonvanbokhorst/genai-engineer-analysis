        "rationale": "The job ad focuses exclusively on tasks related to training, evaluating, and crafting data for AI models, which falls under Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization). Specifically, the tasks of 'training AI models', 'crafting and answering questions related to computer science to help train AI models', and 'evaluating and ranking code generated by AI models' are all core to model development and fine-tuning (1.B.1). There are no tasks mentioned that fall under Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering), such as software development, integration, or MLOps. Therefore, the role is predominantly focused on AI specialization, fitting the 'ML Specialist (Data Scientist)' profile, even though the models are generative in nature, the core tasks are about model training and evaluation."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the core tasks involved in training and evaluating AI models. However, it lacks specific details about the *type* of AI models beyond 'generative artificial intelligence models' and doesn't mention any specific technologies or software engineering practices, which would have made the classification even more definitive. The profile assignment is strong based on the described tasks, but the lack of technical specifics prevents a perfect score."
