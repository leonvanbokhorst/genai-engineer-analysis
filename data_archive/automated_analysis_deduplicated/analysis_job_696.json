While it mentions using generative AI tools to expedite delivery and enhance quality, it explicitly states 'not building new AI models from scratch' and focuses on 'leveraging and fine-tuning existing models'. The core responsibility is to integrate AI into the software development process and products, rather than specializing in AI model development or research. This aligns with the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile, where the role is primarily software engineering with a strong focus on integrating AI capabilities."
