While 'Big Data Analytics' is mentioned, there is no specific mention of Generative AI, LLMs, RAG, or traditional ML model development/fine-tuning. The role is about demonstrating and integrating a platform's capabilities to solve customer data challenges, which aligns with building or maintaining software that uses data intelligence features, rather than developing AI models themselves. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to software integration, customer interaction, and technical advisory. However, it lacks specific details about AI/ML tasks, focusing more on the broader 'Data Intelligence Platform' and 'Big Data Analytics'. The absence of explicit AI/ML model development or GenAI specific tasks makes it lean towards an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, but the lack of direct AI/ML task coding prevents a perfect score."
