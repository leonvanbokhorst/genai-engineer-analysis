The provided 'CODING_BOOK.md' is specifically designed for analyzing AI/ML roles. As this ad lacks any AI/ML components, it does not fit any of the defined AI-focused profiles. The 'Software Engineer' profile requires tasks from Macro-Category A, but no such tasks are described in the provided text. Therefore, the most appropriate classification according to the coding book's scope is 'Not Relevant'."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is extremely brief, containing only a title and a key technology. It provides no descriptive text for tasks or responsibilities, making it impossible to perform a detailed analysis against the 'CODING_BOOK.md's categories for tasks or soft skills. The classification of 'Not Relevant' is based on the absence of AI/ML content, but the actual role is a software engineering one, which is outside the primary scope of the provided coding book's detailed categories. The analysis is therefore highly speculative due to lack of data."
