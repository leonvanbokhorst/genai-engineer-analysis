        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on traditional ML tasks such as 'statistical models' and 'predictive algorithms' for 'revealing hidden patterns'. While it mentions 'generative AI' in a question about ethical deployment, the core responsibilities described are centered around traditional ML. The role also emphasizes developing 'end-to-end solutions' and 'robust solutions used in production', indicating a blend of ML specialization (Macro-Category B) and software engineering integration (Macro-Category A). Given the strong emphasis on traditional ML and the mention of operationalizing solutions, 'Core ML Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the core responsibilities related to traditional machine learning and the development of production-ready solutions. It also touches upon generative AI in a forward-looking manner. The language is specific enough to make a confident classification, though the explicit mention of 'generative AI' in a question rather than a core task prevents a perfect score."
