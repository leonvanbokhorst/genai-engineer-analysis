        "rationale": "The job ad focuses on 'supporting the development of assets (e.g., plugins)' which is a core software engineering task (Macro-Category A). It also mentions 'AI R&D initiatives' which touches upon AI specialization (Macro-Category B). However, the emphasis on developing 'assets' and 'plugins' to drive an 'AI strategy' suggests the primary focus is on building software that leverages AI, rather than deep AI model development or GenAI specialization. The role appears to be integrating AI capabilities into broader firm strategies through software development."

        "score": 3,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is very brief and lacks specific details about the nature of the AI R&D or the types of assets/plugins to be developed. While it clearly points towards a software engineering role with an AI component, the exact balance and focus (traditional ML vs. GenAI) are not explicitly stated, leading to a moderate confidence score."
