Software Development & Integration), such as ensuring scalability and reliability of systems, building services and databases, developing quality assurance functionality, and integrating an AI platform. While it explicitly mentions LLM and generative AI models, the responsibilities described are about building and maintaining the software *around* these models, not about developing, fine-tuning, or engineering the models themselves. This aligns with the AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile, which is characterized by predominantly Macro-Category A tasks that integrate AI/ML features into a product."

It explicitly states 'Senior Back End Developer' and details responsibilities that are squarely within software engineering, albeit in the context of AI/LLM infrastructure. There's no ambiguity about the core tasks being software development and integration. The distinction between building *around* AI and building *AI itself* is clear."
