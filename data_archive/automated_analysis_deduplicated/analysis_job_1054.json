There are no explicit tasks related to AI model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or specific GenAI data engineering. The role is situated within a 'Speech Analytics Team' and offers 'learning about AI,' indicating an AI-related domain context. The developer's responsibilities are primarily to support the application and its integrations, fitting the definition of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer who 'builds or maintains software that directly uses or supports AI/ML models as a core part of its functionality.' The developer's work supports the AI-focused team and application, even if they are not directly building the AI models themselves."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the responsibilities as traditional software engineering tasks. The AI context is inferred from the team name and a learning opportunity, which is sufficient to classify the role as 'AI-Adjacent.' The tasks themselves are unambiguously classified under Macro-Category A, and the profile assignment is well-supported by the evidence, though not explicitly stating direct AI model interaction."
