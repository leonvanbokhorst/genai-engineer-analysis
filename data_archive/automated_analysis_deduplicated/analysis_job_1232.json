It also explicitly mentions working with Generative AI and classic NLP tasks, designing experiments, and evaluating models, which falls under Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization). The balance of tasks, with a strong emphasis on engineering and productization alongside model experimentation, points towards a 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile, as it requires both strong software engineering skills and specialized knowledge in Generative AI."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is very clear about the responsibilities, explicitly mentioning both software engineering practices (productization, MLOps, architecture, testing) and AI/ML tasks (experiments, evaluations, Generative AI, NLP). The breakdown of time allocation (20% research, 20% design, 60% engineering) further solidifies the classification. The role of the first technical hire also implies a broad scope covering both development and specialized AI work."
