While AI is mentioned as a component of the applications, the core responsibilities and technologies listed are primarily software engineering. There are no specific tasks or tools mentioned that relate to core AI/ML model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. The role is about building applications that *use* AI, rather than developing the AI itself. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software development tasks using specific frameworks. However, the mention of 'AI' and '(gen)AI toepassingen' is somewhat general, and the specific AI tasks are not detailed. This leaves a slight ambiguity about the depth of AI involvement beyond integration, preventing a perfect score."
