    "profile": {
        "assigned_profile": "Core ML Engineer",
        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on traditional machine learning tasks such as 'verwerken van complexe data door middel van machine learning, data mining en deep learning technologieën' and 'statistische modellen en voorspellende algoritmes'. While it mentions developing 'end-to-end solutions' and 'robust solutions that are used in production', which are software engineering tasks (1.A.1), the core emphasis and examples provided lean towards traditional ML rather than Generative AI. There are no mentions of LLMs, RAG, or GenAI-specific frameworks. Therefore, the role is classified as a Core ML Engineer."
    },
    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to traditional ML and the operationalization of models. However, it lacks specific details about the types of models or the exact technologies used, and it does not mention Generative AI at all. This makes the distinction between a 'Core ML Engineer' and potentially an 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' (if the operationalization part was more emphasized) clear, but the absence of GenAI specifics prevents a perfect score."
