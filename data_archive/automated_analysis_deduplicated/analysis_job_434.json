While it mentions 'AI-generated summaries' which hints at generative AI (1.B.2), the overall emphasis is on using AI as a tool to improve existing software development and product offerings, rather than deep specialization in AI model development or GenAI-specific tasks. The role is about elevating software solutions with AI as a co-pilot, fitting the description of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the integration of AI into software development processes and product enhancement. The tasks lean heavily towards software engineering with AI as a supporting element. However, the specific AI techniques or models are not detailed, and the mention of 'AI-generated summaries' is the only strong indicator of generative AI, making it slightly less definitive than a role explicitly detailing LLM work. The profile assignment is strong, but a higher score would require more explicit detail on the AI components."
