While 'generative AI' and 'data science' are mentioned as the domain, there are no specific tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or data engineering for AI models (Macro-Category B). The role focuses on developing software solutions and 'smarter apps' within the context of AI/GenAI, making it an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer role."

However, it lacks specific details about the AI/GenAI tasks or technologies involved, making it slightly less precise than an ad that would explicitly list LLM frameworks or model training responsibilities. The 'Fullstack Developer' title is a strong indicator, but the exact nature of the AI integration remains somewhat general."
