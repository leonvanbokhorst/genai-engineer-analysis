        "rationale": "The job ad focuses exclusively on machine learning research, model development, evaluation, and data research within a financial context. There are no mentions of software development, integration, MLOps, or specific Generative AI tasks like prompt engineering or RAG. The tasks described are predominantly within Macro-Category B, specifically 'Model Development & Fine-Tuning' and 'Data Engineering & Management', with no tasks from Macro-Category A. This aligns with the 'ML Specialist (Data Scientist)' profile."
