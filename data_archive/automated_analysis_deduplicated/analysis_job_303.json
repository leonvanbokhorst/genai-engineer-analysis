The core responsibilities (1.B.1) are centered around interacting with and improving AI models. While it mentions software engineering expertise, the primary focus is on the AI model training aspect rather than building software applications that integrate AI. There are no explicit mentions of software development and integration (1.A.1) or MLOps (1.A.2) tasks. Therefore, the 'GenAI Specialist' profile, which emphasizes tasks from Macro-Category B related to Generative AI, is the most appropriate fit."

The absence of traditional software engineering tasks (1.A.1) and MLOps (1.A.2) also helps in narrowing down the profile. However, the ad is quite brief and doesn't go into deep technical details about the specific AI models or the exact nature of the 'questions' to be created, which prevents a perfect score."
