While it mentions 'data science methodologies', it does not specify any Generative AI tasks or technologies. The core responsibilities align with traditional data science and data engineering roles that support ML initiatives, rather than a software engineering role integrating AI or a specialized GenAI role. Therefore, 'ML Specialist (Data Scientist)' is the most fitting profile, as the emphasis is on data analysis, model building, and leveraging data science for business insights."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to data analysis, machine learning methods, and data-driven insights. It explicitly states the role is 'Data Engineer' and details tasks that fall under data engineering and traditional ML/data science. However, it lacks specific mention of Generative AI technologies, making it lean towards a traditional ML/Data Science profile. The confidence is high because the tasks are well-defined within the data science/engineering domain, but not a perfect 5 as there's no explicit mention of AI/ML models beyond 'machine learning methods'."
