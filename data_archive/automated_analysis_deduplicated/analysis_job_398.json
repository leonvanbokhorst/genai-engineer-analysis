While the LLM part is a proof of concept, it's a significant component. The role isn't purely software engineering nor purely a specialist in LLMs, suggesting a balanced mix, leaning towards GenAI due to the explicit mention of LLM development."

The profile assignment is relatively straightforward based on these two components. However, it's an internship, so the depth of involvement in each area might be less than a full-time role, leading to a slightly lower confidence score than a perfect 5."
