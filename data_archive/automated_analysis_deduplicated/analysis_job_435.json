While it mentions 'AI-generated summaries' which hints at generative AI, the core focus remains on integrating AI into existing software development processes and products, rather than specializing in AI model development or deep generative AI tasks. The role is about using AI as a co-pilot to enhance software engineering, fitting the description of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

The tasks are predominantly aligned with Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering), with some mention of AI-specific applications like summaries. The profile assignment is straightforward based on this balance. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the specific AI tasks are not deeply detailed, leaving a slight ambiguity about the depth of AI specialization beyond integration."
