While it mentions 'Machine Learning solutions' and 'Machine Learning applications', the core responsibilities and the title 'Software Engineer' indicate that the primary focus is on the software development and integration aspect (Macro-Category A), rather than deep model development or GenAI specialization (Macro-Category B). The role involves building software *for* ML solutions, not necessarily developing the ML models themselves. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the responsibilities, which are predominantly software engineering tasks. The mention of ML applications and cloud platforms provides context. However, it doesn't delve into specific GenAI techniques or traditional ML model development details, making it lean towards the 'AI-Adjacent' category rather than a specialized AI/ML role. The confidence is high but not perfect due to the lack of explicit GenAI or deep ML model specifics."
