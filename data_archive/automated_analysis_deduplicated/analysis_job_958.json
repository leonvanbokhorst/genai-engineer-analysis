        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on tasks related to training and evaluating generative AI models, specifically through providing feedback and answering computer science-related questions to improve model performance. While it mentions 'software engineer' in the introduction, the core responsibilities described (1.B.1) are centered around AI model interaction and improvement rather than traditional software development (Macro-Category A). There are no tasks related to software integration, MLOps, or general software engineering practices. Therefore, the role is best classified as a 'GenAI Specialist'."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the core tasks related to AI model training and evaluation. However, it lacks specific details about the technologies used or the broader software engineering context, which prevents a perfect score. The emphasis on 'no prior AI experience required' also suggests a focus on the task itself rather than deep technical expertise in AI development."
