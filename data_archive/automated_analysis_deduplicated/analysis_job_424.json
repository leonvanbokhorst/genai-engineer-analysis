While AI is mentioned as a tool to enhance these processes ('leverage AI to craft intelligent solutions', 'AI-driven innovations', 'integrate AI-driven solutions'), there are no specific tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. The role is about building software that *uses* AI, rather than building or specializing in AI models themselves. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."
