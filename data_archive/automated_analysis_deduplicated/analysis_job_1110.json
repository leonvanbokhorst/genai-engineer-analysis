The tasks described fall predominantly under Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering), specifically 'Software Development & Integration'. While AI is mentioned as a tool and a system type, there is no indication of core AI/ML model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. The role is about using AI as a component within a broader system to improve existing processes, rather than developing the AI models themselves. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the responsibilities and distinguishes itself from traditional engineering roles. It emphasizes the use of AI as a tool for optimization and automation within existing systems. However, the specific AI technologies or models are not detailed, and the term 'AI-driven systems' is somewhat general. The classification of 'scripting' and specific network functions (AAA, PCRF, etc.) as 'Other Technical Skills' rather than a specific AI category is based on their general nature in system administration, even when AI tools are used to manage them. The confidence is high due to the clear focus on system integration and operational improvement using AI, but not perfect due to the lack of specificity in the AI components."
