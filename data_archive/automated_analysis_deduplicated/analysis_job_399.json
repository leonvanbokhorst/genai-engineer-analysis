        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on traditional software engineering tasks (1.A.1) such as translating business demands into solutions, implementation, and production. While it mentions working with data and fields like NLP, time series modeling, and image recognition (1.B.3), it does not specify any tasks related to developing, fine-tuning, or engineering generative AI models (1.B.1, 1.B.2). The role is primarily about data engineering and integrating insights into solutions, fitting the profile of a Software Engineer who works with AI/ML features as part of a product, rather than specializing in the AI/ML models themselves. The emphasis is on the 'engineer/developer' aspect and solving business problems through data, not on core AI model development or GenAI specifics."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly defines the role as 'Data Engineer/Developer' and outlines many traditional software engineering and data engineering tasks. However, it lacks specific details about the AI/ML technologies or models used, making it difficult to definitively place it within a GenAI or core ML context. The mention of NLP, time series, and image recognition is broad and could apply to various ML specializations, but not specifically GenAI. The confidence is high for it being an AI-adjacent role but moderate for distinguishing between a general AI/ML adjacent role and a more specific GenAI or ML role due to the lack of specific GenAI/ML model details."
