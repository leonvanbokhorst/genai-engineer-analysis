        "rationale": "The title 'ML Engineer' and the domain 'Recommendations' strongly indicate a focus on traditional machine learning tasks rather than Generative AI. The 'Lead' designation suggests a senior role that balances ML specialization (Macro-Category B) with software engineering practices (Macro-Category A), aligning with the Core ML Engineer profile."

        "reasoning": "The job advertisement is extremely minimal, containing only the job title. This lack of descriptive text prevents any meaningful analysis of job tasks, technologies, or soft skills as required by the CODING_BOOK.md. The profile assignment is based entirely on inferences drawn from the title, making it highly speculative and lacking concrete evidence from the provided text."
