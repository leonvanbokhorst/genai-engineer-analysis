Phrases like 'help train AI models', 'Crafting and answering questions related to computer science in order to help train AI models', and 'Evaluating and ranking code generated by AI models' clearly fall under Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization). There are no tasks mentioned that fall under Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering), such as building applications, developing APIs, or managing MLOps pipelines. Therefore, the role is predominantly focused on the AI specialization aspect, making 'ML Specialist (Data Scientist)' the most fitting profile, even though it specifies generative AI."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines tasks related to training and evaluating AI models. However, it lacks specific technical tools or detailed software engineering responsibilities, making it slightly less definitive than a role with explicit engineering tasks. The focus is clearly on the AI model interaction and training aspect."
