While it mentions AI and ML in the context of client projects and collaboration, the core responsibilities described are centered around software engineering and data engineering rather than specific AI model development, fine-tuning, or prompt engineering (Macro-Category B tasks). The role is about building the infrastructure and applications that *support* AI/ML, rather than developing the AI models themselves. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering and data engineering tasks, along with specific technologies. However, it lacks explicit details about the AI/ML models or generative AI techniques that would be used, making it lean towards an adjacent role rather than a core AI/ML role. The mention of 'AI Engineer' in the title is somewhat ambiguous given the described tasks."
