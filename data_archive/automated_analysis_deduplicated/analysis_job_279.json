        "rationale": "The job ad describes a mix of core software engineering tasks (data pipelines, Linux server management) and specific Generative AI tasks (GenAI Suite, Klus Coach). While data engineering is present, the explicit mention and development focus on generative AI projects, alongside the data engineering responsibilities, points towards a balanced role with a strong emphasis on GenAI. The presence of Dataiku and Snowflake also supports the data engineering aspect, but the generative AI components are key differentiators for this profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to both data engineering and generative AI. The mention of specific generative AI projects like 'GenAI Suite' and 'Klus Coach' is strong evidence. However, the depth of involvement in the 'GenAI Suite' and 'Klus Coach' development (e.g., model training vs. integration) is not fully detailed, which prevents a perfect score. The data engineering aspects are also well-defined."
