The core tasks involve advising clients, configuring software platforms, and validating deliverables using AI, which aligns with Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering). There is no mention of developing, fine-tuning, or deeply understanding the mechanics of AI models themselves (Macro-Category B). The role is about leveraging AI as a tool to enhance existing consulting and software delivery processes, rather than building AI systems. The explicit statement 'Coding or programming' is not a requirement further solidifies this classification. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile, where the primary focus is on software integration and delivery, augmented by AI."
