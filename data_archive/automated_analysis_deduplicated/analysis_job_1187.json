It also includes fine-tuning Large Language Models (1.B.2) and deploying MLOps pipelines (1.A.2). While there's a mention of GenAI, the core focus on building and deploying various ML models, alongside the integration of AI solutions, suggests a strong foundation in traditional ML, with Generative AI as an additional capability. The role requires a balanced mix of software engineering (1.A.1) and AI specialization (1.B.1, 1.B.2), but the emphasis on diverse ML model building leans it towards 'Core ML Engineer' rather than 'Core GenAI Engineer'."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines both traditional ML tasks and Generative AI tasks, along with software engineering and MLOps responsibilities. The distinction between the types of ML models to be built (predictive, segmentation) and the mention of LLM fine-tuning provides good evidence for classification. However, the exact balance and depth of focus between traditional ML and GenAI could be slightly clearer, leading to a high but not perfect confidence score."
