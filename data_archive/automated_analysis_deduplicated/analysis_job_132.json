These tasks fall under Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering), specifically 1.A.2 Operations & MLOps (LLMOps). While the role supports teams developing 'cutting edge solutions in generative video synthesis' and mentions 'large models', the core responsibilities are operational and infrastructural, rather than directly developing or fine-tuning AI models (Macro-Category B). There is no mention of specific GenAI tasks like prompt engineering, RAG, or model development itself. Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, as it builds and maintains the essential data infrastructure that supports AI/ML development, but does not directly engage in the AI model creation or specialization."
