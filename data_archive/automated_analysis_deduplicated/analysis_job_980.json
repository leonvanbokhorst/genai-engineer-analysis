        "rationale": "The job ad describes a role for an experienced software engineer who will use their coding expertise to train AI models, specifically generative AI models that write code. This indicates a balanced mix of core software engineering tasks (lending coding expertise) and AI specialization tasks (training GenAI models). While specific GenAI technologies are not explicitly mentioned, the focus on 'generative AI models' and their output ('write better code') strongly points towards a GenAI specialization within a balanced role."
