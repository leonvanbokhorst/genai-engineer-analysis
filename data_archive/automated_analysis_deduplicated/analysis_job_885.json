While it mentions working with 'AI (LLM)' and 'Azure Cloud Stack', these are presented as new technologies to explore and integrate, rather than the core focus of model development or specialized GenAI tasks. The role is about building software that *uses* AI, not about building the AI itself. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile, where the core is software engineering (Macro-Category A) with an integration of AI/ML features."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about its core responsibilities being backend software development. The mention of AI (LLM) is present but not detailed, suggesting it's an area of growth or integration rather than the primary focus. The confidence is high because the core tasks are well-defined within Macro-Category A, but not a perfect 5 due to the limited detail on the AI aspect."
