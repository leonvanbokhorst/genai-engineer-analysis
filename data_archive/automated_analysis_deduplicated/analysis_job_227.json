While LLM and RAG are mentioned, the emphasis and detailed tasks lean towards traditional ML model development and integration. The role involves building and implementing these solutions into applications, indicating a balance between core ML specialization (Macro-Category B) and software integration (Macro-Category A), fitting the 'Core ML Engineer' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to ML model development, data handling, and integration into applications. The mention of specific ML techniques and frameworks provides good detail. However, the ad is somewhat repetitive and could be more structured. The inclusion of LLM/RAG alongside traditional ML tasks makes the 'Core ML Engineer' profile the most fitting, but a slightly stronger emphasis on GenAI specific tasks would have pushed confidence to 5."
