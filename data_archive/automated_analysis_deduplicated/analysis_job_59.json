While it mentions AI, it does not detail specific AI model development, fine-tuning, or prompt engineering tasks (Macro-Category B). The operational aspects (1.A.2) and the need for learning (3.2) are also present. The primary emphasis is on building and deploying software that incorporates AI, making it an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer role."

However, it lacks specific details about the AI technologies or the depth of AI involvement, making it slightly less definitive than an ad that explicitly mentions LLMs, model training, or specific AI frameworks. The profile assignment is strong based on the provided text, but a higher score would require more explicit AI task details."
