        "rationale": "The job ad primarily focuses on traditional software engineering tasks (translating business processes into applications, microservices architecture, CI/CD, AWS Serverless) and explicitly mentions Python as the core language. While it mentions 'data science and generative AI' and the desire to 'make great strides' in these areas, the core responsibilities described are those of a Senior Software Developer. The AI/GenAI aspect appears to be an area of future development or integration rather than the primary focus of the role's day-to-day tasks. Therefore, the role is classified as AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, as it involves building software that will likely incorporate AI/ML features, but the core of the work remains software development."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the core software engineering responsibilities and technologies. However, the mention of 'generative AI' is somewhat aspirational and not detailed with specific tasks or tools related to GenAI, making it slightly less definitive than a role explicitly detailing LLM development or RAG implementation. The primary focus remains on traditional software development."
