        "rationale": "The job advertisement explicitly mentions 'generative AI' as a context for development. However, all the detailed tasks described (architecture, design, delivery, deployment, scaling, microservices, SRE, DDD, software craftsmanship) are core software engineering activities. There is no mention of specific AI/ML model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG implementation. The role focuses on building and integrating software systems, potentially incorporating AI/GenAI features, but the primary responsibilities are rooted in traditional software engineering."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly indicates a strong focus on software engineering practices within a generative AI context. However, it lacks specific technical tools and detailed AI-specific tasks, making the exact nature of the AI integration less explicit. The overall profile is clear, but the depth of AI involvement is not detailed."
