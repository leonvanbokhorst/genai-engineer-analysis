While it heavily involves operational and integration tasks (Macro-Category A), the explicit mention of 'LLM Services' and the context of an 'Analytics Center of Excellence' suggest a strong focus on Generative AI. The role is not purely software engineering as it directly deals with AI services and MLOps. It's not a 'GenAI Specialist' because it also includes significant software engineering and operational tasks. It leans towards a 'Core GenAI Engineer' due to the blend of MLOps, LLM services, and the integration of AI into production, with a balanced mix of A and B tasks, specifically focused on GenAI."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to MLOps, LLM services, and cloud infrastructure. The tasks are well-defined, allowing for confident classification. The profile assignment is also quite clear due to the specific mention of 'LLM Services' and the MLOps context. A score of 4 reflects high confidence, with a slight deduction because the term 'LLM Services' is somewhat general and could encompass more than just generative models, though the context strongly implies it."
