While it mentions 'AI-generated summaries', the core focus remains on integrating AI into existing software development workflows and enhancing the software product suite. There's no deep dive into model development, fine-tuning, or specific GenAI frameworks, positioning this role as a software engineer who leverages AI, rather than a specialist in AI model creation. The tasks are predominantly from Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration), with a clear emphasis on using AI to improve these processes and outcomes."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly positions the role as a software engineer who uses AI as a tool to enhance development processes and product features. The language is consistent in emphasizing software development with AI augmentation. However, it lacks specific technical details about the AI models or frameworks used, which would have elevated the confidence to a 5. The distinction between AI-Adjacent Software Engineer and Core GenAI Engineer is clear based on the provided text."
