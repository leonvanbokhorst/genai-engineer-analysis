        "rationale": "The job advertisement focuses heavily on tasks related to training and evaluating generative AI models, specifically by creating and answering computer science questions and assessing AI-generated code. While it mentions the need for software engineering expertise in coding, the core responsibilities (1.B.1) are centered around the AI model's learning process rather than integrating AI into a broader software product (1.A.1). There are no explicit mentions of software development, integration, or MLOps tasks. Therefore, the role is best classified as a GenAI Specialist."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the tasks related to training and evaluating generative AI models. However, it is somewhat light on specific technical tools or detailed software engineering aspects, which would have increased confidence further. The emphasis on 'no prior AI experience required' and the freelance/remote nature also suggest a focus on the task execution rather than deep system architecture."
