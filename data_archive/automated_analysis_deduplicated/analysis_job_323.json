        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite specific about the tasks involved in training and evaluating AI models. However, it lacks detail regarding specific technologies or the broader software engineering aspects that would be present in a more integrated role. The profile assignment is clear based on the provided tasks, but the lack of technical specifics limits the confidence to a high but not perfect score."
