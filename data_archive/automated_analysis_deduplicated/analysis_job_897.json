While it mentions 'emerging technologies', it does not specify any AI/ML models, generative AI, or related tasks like prompt engineering or RAG. The core responsibilities fall under traditional software development and integration (Macro-Category A) without any tasks from Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization). Therefore, the most appropriate profile is 'Software Engineer'."
