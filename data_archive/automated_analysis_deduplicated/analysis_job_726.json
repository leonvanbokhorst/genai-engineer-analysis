While it mentions DeepL's expertise in AI and generative AI, the role itself does not require the development, fine-tuning, or deep integration of AI/ML models. The mention of 'Experience in AI, ML, or natural language processing would be a significant plus' indicates it's a desirable but not essential skill for this specific role, which is primarily a Full Stack Software Developer role. Therefore, the profile is 'Software Engineer'."
