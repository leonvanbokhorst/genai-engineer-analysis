While there are tasks related to AI improvement and fine-tuning (Macro-Category B), the primary emphasis is on integrating these AI capabilities into a customer support system and improving the overall process. The role is not primarily about developing novel AI models from scratch or deep research into AI algorithms, but rather about leveraging and enhancing existing AI for a specific application. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile as it involves building and maintaining software that directly uses and improves AI features."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to AI integration and improvement within a customer support context. The distinction between core AI development and AI-adjacent application is reasonably clear, though some phrases could be interpreted in multiple ways. The absence of specific technologies makes it harder to definitively classify the depth of AI involvement, but the overall task description is coherent."
