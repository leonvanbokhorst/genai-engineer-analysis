While it mentions 'data science and analytics' and 'Big Data Analytics advisor', there is no specific mention of AI/ML models, generative AI, or related tasks (like model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, RAG). The role is about demonstrating and integrating a platform that *enables* data science and analytics, rather than building or specializing in AI/ML models themselves. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile, where the core is software engineering with an application in the data/analytics space."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the responsibilities being related to a data platform and pre-sales engineering. However, it doesn't explicitly mention AI/ML models or generative AI, which are key differentiators for other profiles. The confidence is high that it's not a core AI/ML role, but there's a slight ambiguity if 'data science and analytics' implicitly includes AI/ML tasks not detailed. The absence of specific AI/ML technologies or tasks leads to a strong classification but not a perfect 5."
