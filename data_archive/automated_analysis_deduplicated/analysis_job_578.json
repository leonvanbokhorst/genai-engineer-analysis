Crucially, it explicitly mentions 'leveraging open source large language models' and developing 'MLops pipeline'. While it covers traditional ML tasks like fraud detection, the explicit mention of LLMs and the focus on MLOps, combined with the need to design and manage ML solutions, points towards a role that balances core ML engineering with specific GenAI applications. The tasks lean towards both Macro-Category A (MLOps, lifecycle management) and Macro-Category B (LLMs, ML solution design, data insights), with a clear emphasis on Generative AI. Therefore, 'Core GenAI Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

However, it doesn't go into extreme detail about the specific GenAI techniques beyond 'leveraging open source large language models', which slightly reduces the confidence from a perfect score."
