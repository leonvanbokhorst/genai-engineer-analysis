While AI and data science are mentioned as areas of investigation and application, the core responsibilities revolve around managing, developing, and deploying these tools within the legal practice, rather than deep model development or specialized GenAI tasks. The role acts as a bridge, applying technology to business problems, which aligns with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

The tasks lean towards software development and process improvement rather than core AI model building. The mention of 'generative AI' is present but not the sole focus. The profile assignment is strong, but a slightly higher score would be warranted if there were more explicit details on the AI/ML tasks themselves."
