The role also involves developing solutions with clients (Macro-Category C task). This indicates a balanced mix of core software engineering (A) and AI specialization (B), with a clear focus on generative AI. The 'Mendix Engineer' title suggests a strong software engineering foundation, making 'Core GenAI Engineer' the most fitting profile."

The mention of 'generatieve AI' is specific. The classification is straightforward based on the provided categories. A score of 4 reflects high confidence, with a slight deduction for the brevity of the ad which could leave room for minor interpretation."
