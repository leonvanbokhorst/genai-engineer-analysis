        "rationale": "The job description focuses on applying human expertise to improve AI systems and integrating AI capabilities into customer support. While there's an element of AI model fine-tuning (1.B.1), the primary emphasis is on using and improving existing AI systems within a support context, rather than core AI model development or deep generative AI specialization. The role involves integrating AI into a broader system (customer support) and improving that system, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile which is predominantly Macro-Category A with AI integration."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to AI system improvement and integration within a customer support context. While it mentions 'fine-tuning sessions', the overall scope leans more towards applying and enhancing AI within an existing operational framework rather than deep AI research or development. The profile assignment is reasonably confident based on this emphasis."
