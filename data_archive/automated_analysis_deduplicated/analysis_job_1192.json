It also includes translating guidelines into machine learning algorithms (1.B.1) and fine-tuning generative AI models. However, the core focus remains on integrating these AI solutions into existing processes and products, rather than deep model research or pure AI system development. The emphasis is on the application and integration of AI within a broader product development context, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

While it mentions AI and machine learning, the primary framing is around exam development and product integration. The tasks related to AI are more about applying and fine-tuning within existing processes rather than building AI systems from scratch. The profile assignment is reasonably clear, though the balance between 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' and a potential 'Core GenAI Engineer' could be debated if the AI tasks were more central."
