        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on designing and integrating AI into software development processes and architectures (Macro-Category A tasks like 1.A.1). While it mentions R&D in AI (1.B.1), the core emphasis is on leveraging AI to enhance software engineering itself, rather than developing core AI models or GenAI-specific applications. The role is about building AI-driven systems that automate software development, making it an AI-adjacent software engineering role."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly defines the role as integrating AI into software development processes, with a strong emphasis on architecture and improving engineering efficiency. It explicitly states what the role is NOT (routine code maintenance, standard software development without AI integration), which helps in classification. However, the R&D aspect could be interpreted in different ways, slightly reducing the confidence from a perfect score."
