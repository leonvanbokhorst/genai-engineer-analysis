    "profile": {
        "assigned_profile": "Software Engineer",
        "rationale": "The job advertisement focuses on crafting and leveraging test automation frameworks using AI. While AI is mentioned as a tool, the core responsibilities revolve around software development (frameworks, automation) and quality assurance, rather than developing or specializing in AI models themselves. There are no tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or GenAI-specific data engineering. Therefore, the role is classified as a Software Engineer who uses AI as a tool within their engineering discipline."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to software engineering (test automation frameworks) and the use of AI as a tool within that context. It lacks any mention of core AI/ML model development or specialization, making the classification as 'Software Engineer' straightforward. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the specific AI technologies or frameworks are not detailed, leaving a slight ambiguity about the depth of AI integration."
