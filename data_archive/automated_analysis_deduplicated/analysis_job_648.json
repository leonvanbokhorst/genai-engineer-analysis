While it mentions experimenting with AI tools like GPT-4 Vision and optimizing AI solutions (Macro-Category B and MLOps tasks), the core emphasis is on the software engineering aspect of creating and implementing these AI-driven solutions within a broader application context, rather than deep model development or specialization in GenAI tasks. The role is about building software that *uses* AI."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering responsibilities with an AI component. The tasks are well-defined, and the technologies mentioned are specific. The profile assignment is straightforward based on the balance of tasks. A slightly lower score is given because 'AI automations' could be interpreted in various ways, but the context leans heavily towards software integration."
