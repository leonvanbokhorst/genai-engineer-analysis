        "rationale": "The provided job advertisement consists solely of the title 'Front End Developer' and contains no descriptive text regarding tasks, technologies, or soft skills. The analysis framework (CODING_BOOK.md) is designed to categorize AI/ML-related roles. As this advertisement lacks any mention of AI, ML, GenAI, or related concepts, it cannot be classified into any of the AI/ML-specific profiles. While 'Front End Developer' implies core software engineering tasks (Macro-Category A), the ad provides insufficient detail to confirm it is exclusively A and does not integrate AI/ML, which would be required for the 'Software Engineer' profile. Therefore, due to the absence of AI/ML context and lack of detail, the role is considered 'Not Relevant' to the scope of this AI/ML role analysis framework."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 1,
        "reasoning": "The job advertisement is extremely brief, containing only a title. This lack of detail makes it impossible to perform a meaningful analysis of job tasks, technologies, or soft skills, and thus any profile assignment is highly speculative."
