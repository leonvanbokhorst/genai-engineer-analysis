        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on traditional software engineering tasks such as integrating ML models into applications, leading design reviews, code reviews, and documentation. While it mentions 'ML models' and 'Generative AI' in the context of the company's work, the specific responsibilities listed for the role are predominantly within Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering). There are no explicit tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). Therefore, the role is classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, as it involves building software that integrates AI/ML features but does not focus on the AI/ML specialization itself."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering tasks and mentions Python. However, it lacks specific details about the ML models being integrated or the nature of the AI work beyond a general mention of Generative AI in the company context. This leaves some room for interpretation regarding the depth of AI involvement, hence a score of 4."
