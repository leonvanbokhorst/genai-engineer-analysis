While it mentions 'AI-driven solutions' and 'generative AI at our core', it does not detail specific tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). The role is about building software that *uses* AI, rather than building the AI itself. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

However, it lacks specific details about the AI technologies or methodologies to be used, making it slightly less definitive than a role explicitly detailing LLM work. The confidence is high because the software engineering aspects are very clear."
