While AI, NLP, and ML are mentioned as components or enablers for these tools and features, the core tasks do not involve model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or specific AI data engineering. The role is about building software that uses AI/ML, fitting the definition of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."
