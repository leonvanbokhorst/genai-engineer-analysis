        "rationale": "The job ad focuses exclusively on tasks related to training and evaluating generative AI models (specifically LLMs for code generation). There are no mentions of software development, integration, operations, or MLOps. The core activities described fall under 'Model Development & Fine-Tuning' (1.B.1). While it mentions 'experienced software engineer', the tasks themselves are specialized AI training tasks, not general software engineering. Therefore, 'GenAI Specialist' is the most appropriate profile."
