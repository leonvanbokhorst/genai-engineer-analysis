        "rationale": "The job advertisement heavily emphasizes tasks related to data engineering and management, such as managing large datasets, building data pipelines, data ingestion, annotation, access, and tracking. While it mentions supporting ML teams and ML model training, the core responsibilities are focused on the data infrastructure and preparation rather than the development or fine-tuning of ML models themselves. There is no mention of generative AI specific tasks like prompt engineering or LLM development. Therefore, the role aligns best with an ML Specialist (Data Scientist) profile, focusing on the data aspects that underpin ML efforts."

The absence of generative AI specific tasks and the clear emphasis on data infrastructure make the profile assignment straightforward."
