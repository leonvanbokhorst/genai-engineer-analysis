While AI and RAG are mentioned as tools and methods for achieving these goals (e.g., defect detection, conceptualizing features), the core responsibility remains the development and integration of AI into existing software products. The role is not focused on building or fine-tuning AI models themselves (Macro-Category B), but rather on leveraging AI to enhance software engineering practices and product features (Macro-Category A). The primary language used is English, with technical terms like 'C#', 'cloud-native', 'RAG', and 'AI development agents' being prominent."
