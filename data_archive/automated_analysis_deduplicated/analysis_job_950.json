The core responsibilities involve 'crafting and answering questions' and 'evaluating and ranking code generated by AI models' to help train these models. These activities fall under Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization), specifically 'Model Development & Fine-Tuning' (1.B.1). There are no tasks mentioned that fall under Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering), such as software development, integration, or MLOps. Therefore, the role is predominantly focused on the AI specialization aspect, leading to the 'ML Specialist (Data Scientist)' profile, with the understanding that the specialization is in GenAI rather than traditional ML."
