        "rationale": "The job title 'Senior Full-Stack Engineer' strongly indicates a role focused on core software development tasks (Macro-Category A). The provided text contains no mention of AI, ML, or Generative AI tasks or technologies, which is a prerequisite for profiles involving Macro-Category B. Therefore, the role is classified as a Software Engineer, as it exclusively involves tasks from Macro-Category A and does not integrate AI/ML models."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 1,
        "reasoning": "The job advertisement snippet is extremely brief and uses negative framing ('what this role isn't'). It lacks any specific details about job tasks, technologies, or the nature of AI/ML involvement. This prevents a detailed mapping of phrases to the `CODING_BOOK.md` categories for job tasks, technologies, and soft skills, making the analysis highly inferential based primarily on the job title and the absence of AI/ML mentions."
