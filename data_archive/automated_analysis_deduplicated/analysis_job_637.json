While it mentions 'pioneering extensive, strategic projects' and 'leading the charge in R&D', the core tasks described are about integrating AI into the software development lifecycle rather than developing novel AI models or specializing in GenAI techniques like prompt engineering or RAG. The emphasis is on using AI to enhance software engineering, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the use of GenAI to augment software development practices. While it uses strong language about innovation and pioneering, the specific tasks described are more aligned with integrating AI into existing software engineering workflows rather than deep specialization in GenAI model development or advanced prompt engineering. The profile assignment is relatively clear, but the 'strategic projects' and 'R&D' aspects could imply a slightly deeper AI focus, hence not a perfect 5."
