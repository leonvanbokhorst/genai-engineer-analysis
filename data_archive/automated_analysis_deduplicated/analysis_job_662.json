While the products 'deeply leverage AI' and utilize 'generative AI', the engineer's responsibilities are centered on the software development and integration aspects of these AI-powered products, rather than core AI model development, fine-tuning, or specialized GenAI tasks. The technologies mentioned are standard web and cloud frameworks. This aligns with the profile of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer who builds software that supports or uses AI/ML as a core feature."

The profile assignment is well-supported by the text. A score of 4 is given because while 'generative AI' is mentioned, the depth of the engineer's direct involvement with GenAI specifics (beyond integration) is not detailed, leaving a slight ambiguity compared to a role explicitly focused on GenAI model building."
