While there's mention of infrastructure development (1.A.1, 1.A.2), the core focus and innovation are on the AI models themselves (1.B.1, 1.B.3). There's no indication of integrating these LLM capabilities into broader software applications or focusing on traditional ML tasks. Therefore, the role is best classified as a 'GenAI Specialist'."
