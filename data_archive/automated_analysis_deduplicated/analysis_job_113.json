The role is typically associated with hardware maintenance and on-site support, which falls outside the scope of the defined AI/ML profiles."

This title alone is sufficient to determine that the role is not relevant to AI/ML engineering based on the provided coding book's definitions. The lack of any descriptive text makes the classification unambiguous."
