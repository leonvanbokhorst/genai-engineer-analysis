While it mentions supporting 'generative AI' workloads and classical CNNs, the primary focus is on the engineering of the compiler itself, rather than the development or fine-tuning of AI models. The role involves integrating AI capabilities into a platform through the compiler, but the core responsibilities are software engineering. There's no indication of direct model development or prompt engineering as the main focus. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."
