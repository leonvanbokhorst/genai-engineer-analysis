While it explicitly mentions using and integrating state-of-the-art AI technologies like LLMs (GPT-4 Vision) and AI coding assistants (Amazon CodeWhisperer), the core focus remains on building and enhancing software systems that *utilize* these AI technologies. There is no indication of deep model development, fine-tuning, or specialized GenAI research. The role is about integrating AI into existing or new software products to improve functionality and support, fitting the profile of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software development and integration tasks with a focus on using AI technologies. The distinction between building AI-powered software (AI-Adjacent) versus deep AI model work (Specialist/Core Engineer) is reasonably clear, though some phrases could be interpreted as touching on model interaction. The mention of specific AI tools and cloud platforms provides good context. A slightly lower score is given because 'Create and improve autonomous support platforms using LLMs' could imply more than just integration, but the overall emphasis remains on the platform development."
