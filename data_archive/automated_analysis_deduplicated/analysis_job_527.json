While the company engages in discussions about AI applications and mentions tools like 'Runway' related to generative AI, there are no explicit tasks described that fall under Macro-Category B (e.g., model development, prompt engineering, AI data engineering). This suggests the role is focused on building software that leverages or is adjacent to AI, rather than developing AI models themselves, fitting the AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."
