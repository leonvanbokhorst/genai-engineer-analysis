        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on core software engineering tasks such as developing backend systems, cloud-native services, APIs, refining architecture, and optimizing CI/CD pipelines. While it mentions integrating AI models and working with ML engineers, the primary responsibilities and emphasis are on the software engineering aspects of building and maintaining the platform. There is no mention of specific Generative AI tasks like prompt engineering, RAG, or model fine-tuning, nor traditional ML tasks like model development or data science. Therefore, the role is classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, as it builds software that integrates AI but doesn't focus on the AI model development itself."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is very clear and specific about the responsibilities, focusing on backend development, cloud infrastructure, and CI/CD. The distinction between core software engineering and AI specialization is well-defined by the absence of explicit AI model development tasks, making the profile assignment straightforward."
