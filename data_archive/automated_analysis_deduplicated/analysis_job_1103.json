        "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on traditional software engineering tasks such as system configuration, maintenance, and integration of AI tools to enhance operational efficiency. While AI is mentioned as a key component, the core responsibilities revolve around managing and optimizing existing systems and processes using AI, rather than developing novel AI models or deep GenAI-specific tasks like prompt engineering or fine-tuning. The role is described as combining 'hands-on technical work with advanced AI tools to proactively optimize and automate complex support tasks,' which aligns with integrating AI into a software engineering context. The tasks listed under 'What you will be doing' are primarily system building and service configuration, fitting into Macro-Category A. There are no explicit tasks that fall under Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization)."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the responsibilities and distinguishes itself from traditional engineering roles. It emphasizes the use of AI tools within a software engineering context. However, the specific AI technologies or models are not detailed, and the term 'AI tools' is quite general. The classification of 'scripting' and specific network functions (AAA, PCRF, etc.) as technologies could be more precise if specific languages or frameworks were mentioned. The profile assignment is strong based on the described tasks, but a lack of explicit GenAI or traditional ML model development tasks prevents a perfect score."
