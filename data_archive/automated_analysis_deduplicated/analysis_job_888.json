While 'GenAI' is mentioned in the context of data sources for insights and reporting, the core responsibilities and tasks described do not involve the development, fine-tuning, or deep application of generative models themselves. The role is about building and managing data products and BI solutions, which happen to use GenAI data, rather than building GenAI systems. Therefore, it fits the profile of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

The role's emphasis is on building and managing data products and reporting, making the classification relatively straightforward. A slightly lower score is given because the specific technologies or frameworks for GenAI are not detailed, leaving a minor ambiguity about the depth of GenAI involvement."
