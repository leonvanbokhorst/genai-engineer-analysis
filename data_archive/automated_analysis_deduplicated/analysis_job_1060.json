        "rationale": "The job description heavily emphasizes traditional software engineering tasks, leadership, client advisory, and business development (Macro-Category A). While 'genAI' is mentioned as an area to advise on and integrate into architectures, there are no specific tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). The role is about advising on and integrating AI/ML features into client solutions, rather than building the AI models themselves. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

The mention of 'genAI' is in the context of advising on strategies and architectures, not hands-on model development. This clarity allows for a confident assignment of the profile."
