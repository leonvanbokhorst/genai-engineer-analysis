While it mentions leveraging generative AI and creating AI-powered features like a learning copilot and educational content generation, the core responsibilities are centered around software development and integration rather than deep model development or specialized GenAI tasks (Macro-Category B). The role is about building software that *uses* AI, not primarily about developing or fine-tuning the AI models themselves. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

It also clearly states the use of generative AI in product features. The distinction between building AI-powered products and developing AI models is evident, leading to a confident classification. A slightly lower score is given because the depth of AI involvement beyond integration isn't fully detailed, but the overall picture is clear."
