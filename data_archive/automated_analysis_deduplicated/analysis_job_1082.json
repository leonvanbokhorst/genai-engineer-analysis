        "rationale": "The job advertisement consists solely of the title 'Medior Dev Ops Engineer GenAI'. This title strongly suggests a focus on operational aspects ('Dev Ops Engineer') within the domain of Generative AI ('GenAI'). According to the coding book, 'Dev Ops' and 'MLOps' fall under Macro-Category A (specifically `1.A.2. Operations & MLOps (LLMOps)`). As no tasks related to Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization) are mentioned, the role is inferred to be predominantly within Macro-Category A. The `AI-Adjacent Software Engineer` profile is the most fitting, as it describes a role that is mostly in Macro-Category A and integrates AI/ML features into a product. In this context, integrating the operational infrastructure for GenAI is interpreted as a form of feature integration."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 1,
        "reasoning": "The job advertisement is extremely brief, consisting only of a title. This provides insufficient detail to perform a thorough analysis of job tasks, technologies, or soft skills. The profile assignment is based solely on inferring the role's focus from the title, making it highly speculative."
