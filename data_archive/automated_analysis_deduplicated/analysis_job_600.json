The tasks involve explaining and structuring knowledge about LLM architectures, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, RAG, vector databases, MLOps, and AI ethics. While these topics are AI-centric, the core responsibility is educational content creation rather than building or integrating AI into software products. There are no tasks related to Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering). Therefore, the role is best classified as a specialist in GenAI, specifically in an educational context."
