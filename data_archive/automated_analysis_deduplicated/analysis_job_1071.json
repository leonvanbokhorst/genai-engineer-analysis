While it mentions AI, GenAI, LLMs, and OpenAI services, these are presented as features to be integrated into existing .NET applications rather than the core focus of model development or deep AI research. The role requires collaboration with AI specialists but the primary responsibility lies in the software engineering aspect of bringing AI capabilities into the business applications. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering responsibilities and mentions AI integration. The distinction between core AI development and AI integration is reasonably clear, leading to a high confidence score. However, the phrase 'Implement the newest technologies in (Azure) OpenAI' could be interpreted slightly more towards AI specialization, but the overall context strongly favors software engineering."
