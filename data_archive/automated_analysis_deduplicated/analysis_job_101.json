        "rationale": "The job advertisement focuses entirely on traditional backend software engineering tasks such as designing, constructing, implementing, and integrating cloud-native systems, APIs, and protocols. While it mentions 'LLM (Large Language Model)' in the context of applications the platform will cater to, there are no specific tasks or requirements related to developing, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or managing generative AI models themselves. The role is about building the infrastructure that *supports* LLM applications, not about the AI development itself. Therefore, it aligns with the 'Software Engineer' profile."

The mention of LLMs is contextual to the platform's use case rather than a core requirement for AI development, making the classification straightforward."
