        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on implementing GenAI technology into business processes and integrating AI solutions with existing systems, which are core software engineering tasks (Macro-Category A). While it mentions developing AI solutions, the emphasis is on the implementation and integration aspect rather than deep model development or specialization in GenAI techniques like prompt engineering or RAG. The role also includes soft skills like collaboration and continuous learning. Given the primary focus on integration and implementation within business processes, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."
    },
    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is relatively clear about the tasks involved, particularly the integration aspect. However, it lacks specific details about the types of AI solutions or the depth of involvement in model development, making it slightly less definitive than a highly detailed ad. The mention of 'GenAI Engineer' in the title suggests a stronger AI focus than what is detailed in the responsibilities, leading to a slightly lower confidence score."
