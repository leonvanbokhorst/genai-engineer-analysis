        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on collaborating with product teams, analyzing business problems, and developing/integrating/productionizing ML solutions end-to-end. While ML is central, the emphasis is on applying these solutions to business problems and integrating them into existing systems, rather than deep model development or specialization in GenAI-specific tasks like prompt engineering or RAG. The tasks primarily fall under Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration) and Business Understanding, with less emphasis on Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization). Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the collaborative nature of the role and its focus on applying ML to business problems and integrating solutions. However, it lacks specific details about the ML techniques or GenAI technologies to be used, making it slightly less definitive than a role with explicit mentions of LLMs, RAG, or specific model architectures. The profile assignment is strong based on the emphasis on integration and business problem-solving."
