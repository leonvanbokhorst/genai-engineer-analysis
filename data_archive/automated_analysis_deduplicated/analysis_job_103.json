While it mentions computational methods and data analysis, there is no explicit mention of AI/ML models, generative AI, LLMs, or related specialized tasks. The role is about supporting research through software engineering, not building AI/ML systems themselves. Therefore, it fits the 'Software Engineer' profile."
