        "rationale": "The job ad explicitly seeks an 'experienced software engineer' and mentions 'lending your coding expertise to train AI models' and 'helping cutting-edge generative AI models write better code.' While it involves AI model training (1.B.1), the primary framing is that of a software engineer applying their skills to an AI context. There's no indication of building AI infrastructure (1.A.2) or deep specialization in GenAI tasks like prompt engineering or RAG (1.B.2). The role seems to be about leveraging existing software engineering skills to contribute to AI model improvement, making 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' the most fitting profile."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 3,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite brief and focuses heavily on the payment structure and contract details rather than the specific day-to-day tasks. While it mentions 'software engineer' and 'train AI models', it lacks detail on the depth of software engineering required or the specific AI tasks involved beyond general training. This ambiguity leads to a moderate confidence score."
