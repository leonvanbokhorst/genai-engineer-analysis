Crucially, it explicitly mentions GenAI tools (ChatGPT, OpenAI APIs, LangChain) and vector databases, alongside traditional ML model development. The role involves hands-on engineering, client interaction, and mentoring, fitting the 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile due to the blend of software engineering practices with specific Generative AI technologies."
