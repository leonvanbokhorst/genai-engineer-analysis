While it involves AI tasks like fine-tuning and feedback, the primary emphasis is on integrating these AI capabilities into an existing support system and improving the overall resolution process. The tasks lean more towards applying and refining AI within a software context rather than developing core AI models or deep generative AI applications. The role is about augmenting a software-driven support function with AI, making 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' the most fitting profile."
