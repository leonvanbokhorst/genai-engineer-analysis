While AI is central, the focus is on the application and integration of AI solutions within business contexts rather than the core development or fine-tuning of AI models themselves. The tasks are predominantly in Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration, Business Understanding & Strategy), with no explicit mention of model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer role."

It lacks specific details on the AI/ML model development or GenAI specialization tasks, making it lean towards an adjacent role. The confidence is high for this classification, but not a perfect 5 due to the absence of explicit technical AI/ML tasks that would further solidify the classification."
