There are no mentions of software development, integration, or MLOps tasks (Macro-Category A). The role also includes staying updated on trends and collaborating with research teams, which are soft skills. Given the focus on algorithm development and the absence of software engineering tasks, the most fitting profile is 'ML Specialist (Data Scientist)'."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly focuses on AI algorithm design and research within the security domain. While it mentions 'solutions' and 'products', the core tasks described are centered around the AI/ML model development itself, not the integration or deployment into broader software systems. The soft skills are also clearly stated. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the term 'engineer' in the title could sometimes imply more software development, but the description strongly leans towards research and model development."
