        "rationale": "The job ad primarily focuses on traditional software engineering tasks (back-end development, deployment, code reviews, cloud-native applications) and mentions leveraging AI tools to improve these processes. There is no indication of deep model development, fine-tuning, or specific Generative AI tasks like prompt engineering or RAG. The role is about integrating AI into existing software products rather than building AI models from scratch or specializing in GenAI techniques. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering responsibilities and the use of AI as a tool to enhance these. However, it lacks specific details about the AI tools or models to be used, or the depth of AI involvement beyond 'leveraging' them. This leaves a slight ambiguity regarding whether it leans more towards pure software engineering or a deeper AI integration, but the overall emphasis is on software development."
