While there's an element of AI improvement (1.B.1), the primary emphasis is on integrating these AI aspects into a broader support function and prototyping new AI tools (1.A.1). The role is not primarily about developing novel AI models from scratch or specializing deeply in GenAI techniques but rather about leveraging and enhancing AI within an existing operational framework. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile as it involves building or maintaining software that uses AI as a core part of its functionality, without being a deep AI specialist."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to AI integration and improvement within a customer support context. The tasks are specific enough to map to the coding book categories. However, the role is described as 'Technical Support Engineer', which might imply a slightly different focus than a pure 'Software Engineer' role, but the AI-related tasks are prominent. The confidence is high, but not perfect, due to the 'support' aspect which could slightly dilute the 'software engineering' focus compared to a role explicitly titled 'Software Engineer'."
