While it mentions Generative AI, LLM, DialogFlow, and Vertex AI, the core tasks described are about the engineering and integration of these technologies into cloud architectures and data pipelines, rather than deep model development or specialization in GenAI tasks. The emphasis is on building and integrating, making it an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer role."

The mention of AI/LLM technologies provides context, but the primary focus remains on implementation and integration. The profile assignment is straightforward based on the task distribution. A slightly lower score is given because the ad could be more explicit about the *type* of AI/LLM work beyond mentioning specific tools."
