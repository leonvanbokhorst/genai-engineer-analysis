        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on implementing and managing AI solutions within existing business processes ('implementeren en beheren van AI-oplossingen', 'analyseren en optimaliseren van bestaande systemen en processen'). While it mentions research into ChatGPT's capabilities ('onderzoek uitvoeren naar de mogelijkheden van ChatGPT'), the core emphasis is on applying and integrating AI into the business, rather than deep model development or specialization in GenAI tasks like prompt engineering or fine-tuning. The role involves understanding business needs and proposing technological solutions, aligning with the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile which is predominantly Macro-Category A with AI integration."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is reasonably clear about the integration and management aspects of AI within business processes. However, the 'onderzoek' aspect could be interpreted in multiple ways, and the specific AI tasks are not deeply detailed, leading to a slightly less than perfect confidence score. The profile assignment is strongly supported by the emphasis on integration and optimization of existing systems."
