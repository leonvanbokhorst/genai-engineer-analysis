While it mentions exploring GenAI, LLM, and Copilots, these are presented as areas for learning and exploration rather than primary responsibilities. The core duties revolve around building and maintaining cloud infrastructure and pipelines, with AI/ML technologies being a potential addition or area of growth, not the central focus of the role. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer who integrates or supports AI/ML features within a broader software engineering context."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines core infrastructure and DevOps responsibilities. The mention of GenAI/LLM is framed as an area for learning and exploration, not a primary task. This makes the classification relatively straightforward, but a slightly lower score is given because the AI/ML aspect is not deeply integrated into the core duties, leaving some room for interpretation on the exact level of AI involvement."
