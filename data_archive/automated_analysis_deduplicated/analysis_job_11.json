While it mentions generative AI (CodeWhisperer) as a feature being developed, the core responsibilities revolve around software engineering, integration, operations, and customer experience within the IDE context. There are no explicit tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG implementation. Therefore, the role is classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, as it involves building software that integrates AI features, rather than specializing in AI model creation or deployment."

The mention of generative AI is in the context of features to be integrated, not as the core focus of the role's development tasks. The responsibilities are well-defined and align clearly with the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."
