        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on tasks related to ensuring the successful adoption, utilization, and support of AI-driven solutions within a customer context. While it mentions 'prompt engineering' (1.B.2), the majority of the responsibilities fall under Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration), such as training, beta testing, liaison, monitoring, and feedback collection for product improvement. There is no mention of core model development, fine-tuning, or deep AI/ML research. The role is about integrating and supporting AI solutions rather than building them from the ground up or specializing in AI model creation. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to customer success, training, and support for AI-driven products. The mention of prompt engineering is specific, but the overall emphasis is on the integration and user-facing aspects of AI solutions. The profile assignment is strong, but a slightly lower score is given because the role is not a pure software engineering role nor a deep AI/ML role, making it a specific niche within AI-Adjacent. The clarity is good, but not absolute for a perfect score."
