It also includes contributions to 'LLM Ops' and the broader tech strategy for generative AI, indicating a need for operational and strategic thinking around GenAI. While there's a mention of translating business requirements and collaborating with professionals (Macro-Category A aspects), the core emphasis and specific tasks are heavily weighted towards GenAI specialization. The role is not just integrating AI into a product but developing and managing LLM-based solutions. Therefore, it fits the 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile due to the balanced mix of GenAI specialization tasks and the underlying need for engineering practices, with a clear focus on GenAI technologies."
