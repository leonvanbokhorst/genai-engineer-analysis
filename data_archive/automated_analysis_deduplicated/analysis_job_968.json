        "rationale": "The job ad focuses exclusively on tasks related to training and evaluating AI models, specifically generative AI models that write code. There are no mentions of software development, integration, MLOps, or traditional ML tasks. The core responsibilities fall under 'Model Development & Fine-Tuning' (1.B.1). While it mentions 'experienced software engineer', the tasks described are specialized for AI model training rather than general software engineering. Therefore, 'GenAI Specialist' is the most appropriate profile."
