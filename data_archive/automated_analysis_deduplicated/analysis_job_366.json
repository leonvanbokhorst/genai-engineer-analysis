Data Engineering & Management) such as designing data architectures, building data streams, and managing data for AI applications, including a vector database. While there's a mention of contributing to an AI assistant and working with LLM engineers, the core responsibilities are data-centric. There are no tasks related to core software development (1.A.1), model development (1.B.1), or prompt engineering (1.B.2). The role is predominantly focused on Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization) tasks, specifically the data infrastructure required for GenAI. Therefore, GenAI Specialist is the most fitting profile, as it signifies a deep focus on a specific aspect (data) crucial for Generative AI."
