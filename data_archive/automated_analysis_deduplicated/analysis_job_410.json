        "rationale": "The job advertisement is extremely brief, providing only the title 'Technical Co-Founder (CTO & Developer)'. While the 'Developer' aspect implies core software engineering tasks (Category 1.A.1) and 'CTO' implies business understanding and strategy (Category 1.C.1), there is no mention of any AI or Machine Learning tasks or technologies. Therefore, based on the absence of AI/ML specifics and the clear implication of software development duties, the role is classified as 'Software Engineer' according to the provided profiles."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 1,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is exceptionally sparse, containing only a title and company name. This lack of descriptive text prevents a detailed analysis of job tasks, technologies, or soft skills as required by the coding book. The profile assignment is based solely on inferring from the title, leading to very low confidence."
