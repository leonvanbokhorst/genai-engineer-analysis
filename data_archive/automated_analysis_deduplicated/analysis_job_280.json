        "rationale": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities in both core software engineering tasks (data pipelines, Linux server management) and specific Generative AI tasks (GenAI Suite, Klus Coach). While Dataiku and Snowflake are mentioned, the emphasis on 'Generatieve AI' projects and the 'generatieve AI-assistent' strongly suggests a focus on GenAI. The role involves developing and managing infrastructure for AI, and directly working on GenAI applications, indicating a balanced mix of Macro-Category A and B tasks with a clear GenAI specialization."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear in its responsibilities, explicitly mentioning both data engineering/infrastructure tasks and generative AI projects. The tools mentioned (Snowflake, Tableau, Dataiku) are also relevant to the described tasks. The profile assignment is strongly supported by the text. A slightly lower score is given because 'GenAI Suite' and 'Klus Coach' are project names rather than specific, widely recognized GenAI frameworks, which could introduce minor ambiguity if they were very basic implementations. However, the overall description is strong."
