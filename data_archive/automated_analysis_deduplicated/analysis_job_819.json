While it includes AI-specific tasks like working with LLMs (1.B.2) and providing guidance on AI/ML technologies, the core focus remains on integrating these AI elements into a broader software product. The majority of the coded tasks fall under Macro-Category A (Software Engineering), with a significant but secondary focus on Macro-Category B (AI Specialization). This aligns with the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."
