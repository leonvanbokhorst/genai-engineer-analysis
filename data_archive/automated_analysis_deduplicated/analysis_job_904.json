        "rationale": "The job description heavily emphasizes core software engineering tasks such as developing production-quality software, API design, software architecture, testing, and GPU kernel development. While it mentions 'large language model support' and working with 'deep learning software engineers', the primary focus is on building and optimizing the software stack that supports these AI technologies, rather than developing or fine-tuning the models themselves. The role integrates AI/ML features into a product (NVIDIA's AI software stack) and the output of their work is an AI-powered system. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the software engineering nature of the role, with specific examples of tasks. However, the 'large language model support' aspect could be interpreted in slightly different ways, leading to a minor degree of ambiguity regarding the depth of AI model interaction. It's not a 'Core GenAI Engineer' because the focus isn't on model development or prompt engineering, but rather on the software infrastructure around it."
