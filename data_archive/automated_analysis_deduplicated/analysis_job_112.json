        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on implementing and delivering GenAI solutions, which falls under Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration). While 'fine-tune' hints at some model-level work (Macro-Category B), the primary emphasis is on the engineering and implementation aspect of GenAI solutions rather than deep model development or specialization. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer role."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is very brief and uses high-level language. While it clearly indicates a focus on implementing GenAI solutions, it lacks specific details about the nature of the 'fine-tuning' or the exact tasks involved in implementation, making it difficult to assign a more precise profile or categorize specific technologies."
