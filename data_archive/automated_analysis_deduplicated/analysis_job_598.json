While it mentions 'Generative AI' and 'LLM-based Advisor Assist', the core responsibilities are centered around the software engineering aspects of integrating and supporting these AI solutions, rather than developing or fine-tuning the AI models themselves. The role is about building the software infrastructure that *uses* AI, making it an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software development and integration tasks. The mention of AI and LLM is in the context of integration and platform enhancement, not core AI model development. The role title 'Full Stack Developer NodeJS' also aligns with this assessment. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the depth of involvement with 'Generative AI' is not extensively detailed beyond integration."
