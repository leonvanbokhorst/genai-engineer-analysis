        "rationale": "The job advertisement describes a role that is heavily focused on traditional software engineering tasks such as feature development, technical design, operations, and maintenance (all falling under Macro-Category A). While the products are explicitly AI-powered and leverage generative AI, the engineer's responsibilities do not include model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or specific data engineering for models (Macro-Category B). The role is about building and managing the software *around* these AI capabilities. The emphasis on 'leading technical progression,' 'strategic planning,' 'initial design,' 'autonomy,' and 'shaping product direction' further solidifies its position as a senior engineering role. Therefore, the most fitting profile is `AI-Adjacent Software Engineer`, as it involves building software that directly uses AI/ML models as a core part of its functionality, with the output being an AI-powered system."

The tasks clearly align with Macro-Category A, and the product context clearly indicates GenAI. This allows for a confident assignment of the `AI-Adjacent Software Engineer` profile. The lack of specific technology mentions does not obscure the core nature of the role."
