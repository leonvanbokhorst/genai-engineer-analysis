        "rationale": "The job ad focuses entirely on tasks related to training and evaluating generative AI models, specifically LLMs that write code. There are no mentions of traditional software engineering tasks like building applications, CI/CD, or MLOps. The core responsibilities (crafting questions for training, evaluating AI-generated code) fall under the 'GenAI Specialization' macro-category (specifically 1.B.1. Model Development & Fine-Tuning). While it mentions 'experienced software engineer', the tasks described are not about building software but about contributing to the AI model's training process. Therefore, the profile is 'GenAI Specialist'."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is very clear about the specific tasks involved, which are directly related to training and evaluating AI models. The absence of traditional software engineering tasks makes the classification straightforward. The focus on 'training AI models' and 'evaluating code generated by AI models' strongly points to a specialist role in GenAI."
