While it mentions working with 'GenAI technologies' and 'machine learning', these are presented as tools or areas to explore within the broader context of building prototypes and solving customer challenges, rather than the primary focus of model development or specialization. The role is about integrating and applying these technologies into software solutions, fitting the description of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

The emphasis is on building and prototyping solutions for customer challenges using a variety of tools, including GenAI. The profile assignment is straightforward based on this balance. A slightly lower score is given because the specific tasks within GenAI are not detailed, leaving some room for interpretation on the depth of AI involvement."
