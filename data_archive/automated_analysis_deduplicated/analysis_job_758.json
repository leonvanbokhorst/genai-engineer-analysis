The mention of 'NLP experience' suggests the integration of AI/ML capabilities into this software. However, the description does not detail specific Generative AI tasks (like LLMs, RAG) or traditional ML model development. It leans towards using NLP as a feature within a broader software product, making it an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer role."

While it clearly points to a software engineering role with an AI/NLP component, the exact nature and depth of the AI involvement are not specified, making it difficult to assign a more precise profile with high confidence."
