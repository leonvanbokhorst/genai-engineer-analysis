        "rationale": "The job ad primarily focuses on core software engineering tasks (1.A.1) such as designing, developing, testing, securing, and deploying services, as well as infrastructure implementation and optimization. While it mentions the development and deployment of machine learning models and AI algorithms (1.B.1), this is presented as a component within a broader software engineering context, rather than the primary focus. The role is about building a platform that serves SaaS products and integrates AI/ML features into it, rather than specializing deeply in AI model development itself. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering responsibilities and mentions AI/ML tasks as part of the platform development. The distinction between core software engineering and AI specialization is evident, allowing for a confident profile assignment. However, the depth of AI/ML involvement is not as detailed as in a specialist role, preventing a perfect score."
