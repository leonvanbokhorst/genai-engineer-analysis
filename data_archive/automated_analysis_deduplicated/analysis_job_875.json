        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on software development and integration tasks within the Salesforce ecosystem (Macro-Category A), specifically mentioning the development of 'AI-driven solutions' to automate configurations and optimize workflows. While AI is mentioned, the core of the role appears to be the integration and management of these solutions within a specific platform (Salesforce), rather than deep model development or GenAI specialization (Macro-Category B). The mention of CI/CD also falls under software engineering practices. Therefore, it is classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer role."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software development and integration tasks related to Salesforce and CPQ, and mentions the use of AI-driven solutions. However, it lacks specific details about the AI technologies or models involved, making it slightly less definitive than a role explicitly focused on GenAI model building. The confidence is high because the core software engineering aspects are very clear."
