While there is a mention of exploring LLM capabilities with Dify, this is presented as an exploratory task rather than a core requirement, and it is significantly outweighed by the core software engineering duties. Therefore, the role is classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, as it involves building software that may incorporate AI features, but the primary focus remains on software engineering."

The mention of AI/LLM is present but clearly secondary and exploratory. The technologies are well-defined. The overall context strongly points to an AI-Adjacent role, with only minor ambiguity regarding the weight of the exploratory AI mention."
