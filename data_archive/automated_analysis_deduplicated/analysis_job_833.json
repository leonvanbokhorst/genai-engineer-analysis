While it mentions developing AI solutions, the emphasis is on the application and integration rather than deep model development or specialization in GenAI techniques like prompt engineering or RAG. The role involves working with Data Scientists and Engineers but the primary output is the integration of these solutions into client processes. This aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile, where the core is software engineering with AI as a component."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is relatively clear about the integration and application aspects of GenAI. However, it lacks specific details about the exact nature of the 'AI solutions' being developed or integrated, and doesn't mention specific GenAI tools or techniques, making it slightly less definitive than a highly detailed ad. The profile assignment is strong based on the emphasis on integration into business processes."
