        "rationale": "The job ad focuses on developing online creations, banner creation, social media ads, and online videos, which are all core software development and integration tasks (1.A.1). While 'Generative AI' is mentioned as an example of an innovative solution to work on, there are no specific tasks or responsibilities detailed that involve AI/ML model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. The role is primarily about building and integrating creative digital assets and tools, with AI being a potential area of innovation rather than a core technical requirement. Therefore, it aligns best with the 'Software Engineer' profile."
    },
    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is clear about the core tasks being related to online creative development and integration. However, the mention of 'Generative AI' is brief and serves as an example of an innovative area, rather than detailing specific AI/ML responsibilities. This leaves a slight ambiguity about the depth of AI involvement, preventing a perfect score."
