There is no mention of any AI, Machine Learning, or Generative AI tasks, technologies, or responsibilities, which are prerequisites for any of the AI-focused profiles. Thus, it fits the 'Software Engineer' profile, which is defined as exclusively Macro-Category A tasks without AI/ML integration."

        "score": 1,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is exceptionally short and only provides a title. It lacks any descriptive text about responsibilities, technologies (beyond Python), or required skills, making a detailed analysis and confident profile assignment difficult. The classification as 'Software Engineer' is based solely on the absence of AI/ML mentions in the title, which is a very weak signal."
