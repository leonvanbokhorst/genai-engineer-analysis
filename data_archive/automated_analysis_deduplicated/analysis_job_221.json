        "rationale": "The job advertisement primarily focuses on traditional software engineering tasks (developing, deploying, optimizing scalable cloud-native platforms and engines) using Java. While it mentions using AI/ML and NLP to create tools and enhance development efficiency, these are presented as features integrated into the software product or tools to aid development, rather than core AI model development or specialization. The role is about building software that leverages AI, not specializing in AI model creation or deep GenAI tasks. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software development responsibilities and mentions AI/ML as a component of the tools being built or used for development efficiency. The primary language is English. The distinction between building software that *uses* AI versus specializing *in* AI is reasonably clear, leading to a high confidence score. A slightly lower score is given because the specific AI/ML tasks are described in terms of 'tools' and 'features' rather than deep model work, which could be interpreted in multiple ways, but the overall emphasis remains on software engineering."
