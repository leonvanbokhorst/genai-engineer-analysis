        "rationale": "The job ad describes a Back-end Developer role with a significant focus on software development tasks ('maken om interne documenten te gebruiken', 'case-builder opzetten', 'verbeteringen aan onze codebase'). While there is an explicit mention of using ML models (including GPT) for improvement and an opportunity to increase AI knowledge, the primary framing is that of a software engineer who will integrate or experiment with AI. The role is not predominantly focused on AI model development or specialization (Macro-Category B), nor is it a balanced mix of core software engineering and GenAI tasks. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is relatively clear about the core responsibilities being back-end development, with an added element of AI experimentation. The mention of GPT and ML models provides enough context to classify the AI aspect. However, it lacks specific details on the *depth* of AI involvement or the specific technologies beyond 'GPT' and 'open-source models', which prevents a perfect score."
