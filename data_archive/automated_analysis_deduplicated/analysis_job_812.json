While it mentions the adoption of ML/GenAI and analyzing threats which could involve ML techniques (Macro-Category B), the core responsibility is building and operating security services and frameworks. The role is about integrating AI/ML into security products rather than deep model development or GenAI specialization. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering responsibilities and mentions the context of ML/GenAI. However, it doesn't go into deep detail about specific ML/GenAI tasks or technologies, making it slightly less definitive than an ad solely focused on AI model development. The profile assignment is strong based on the emphasis on software development and integration."
