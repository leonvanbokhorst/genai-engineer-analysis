While AI is mentioned as a co-pilot and tool for enhancement, the core focus remains on building and improving software solutions. There are no specific tasks or technologies mentioned that point to deep expertise in model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, where AI is used to augment software engineering practices."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the responsibilities and the role of AI within those responsibilities. The distinction between using AI as a tool to enhance software engineering versus deep AI/ML model work is evident. However, it's not a 5 because the ad uses more evocative language ('superhero status', 'conjuring code like magic') which, while descriptive, could be interpreted slightly more broadly. Nevertheless, the core tasks are well-defined."
