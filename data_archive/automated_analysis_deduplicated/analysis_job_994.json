        "rationale": "The job ad focuses entirely on tasks related to training and evaluating generative AI models, specifically by crafting questions and evaluating code. There are no mentions of software development, integration, MLOps, or traditional ML tasks. The role explicitly states 'no requirement for previous AI experience' but asks for coding expertise to *train* AI models. This strongly aligns with a specialist role focused on the AI model development lifecycle (Macro-Category B) rather than a software engineering role (Macro-Category A)."

        "score": 5,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is very clear about the specific tasks involved: training and evaluating AI models. While it mentions 'software engineer' in the introduction, the detailed responsibilities are purely focused on AI model interaction and data generation for training. The absence of any software engineering tasks (like building applications, pipelines, or integration) makes the classification straightforward."
