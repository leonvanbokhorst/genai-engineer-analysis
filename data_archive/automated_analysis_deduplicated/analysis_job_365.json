While it mentions 'generative AI' as a technology being experimented with in the simulator, the core responsibilities of the intern are to build and integrate the user interface and backend for this simulator. There are no explicit tasks related to developing, fine-tuning, or prompt engineering of AI models themselves. The role is about building software that *uses* or *supports* AI experimentation, rather than being an AI specialist. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

The mention of 'generative AI' is in the context of the simulator's purpose, not the intern's direct responsibilities. The technologies and expected skills align well with a frontend/full-stack developer role, making the classification straightforward."
