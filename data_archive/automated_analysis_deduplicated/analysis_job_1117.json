While there's a mention of AI model fine-tuning (Macro-Category B: Model Development & Fine-Tuning), the core responsibility is to use human expertise to enhance AI performance and integrate AI capabilities into the support process, rather than developing AI models from scratch or specializing deeply in GenAI techniques. The emphasis is on the application and improvement of existing AI within a software context."

The distinction between core AI development and using AI as part of a broader system is evident. The confidence is high, but not perfect, as the 'fine-tuning' aspect could lean slightly towards a specialist role, but the overall framing points to an adjacent software engineering function."
