        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on tasks related to training and evaluating generative AI models, specifically through creating and answering computer science questions and assessing AI-generated code. While it mentions seeking a software engineer, the core responsibilities (1.B.1) are centered on AI model interaction and improvement, with no mention of building software infrastructure or integrating AI into applications (Macro-Category A). Therefore, the role is best classified as a GenAI Specialist."
