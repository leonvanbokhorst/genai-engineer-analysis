It explicitly mentions extending support to generative AI and large-scale models, and requires experience in building and productionizing models. The mention of 'modeling techniques' and 'batch data processing optimization' points to Macro-Category B tasks. Given the blend of core software engineering (building a dev tool) and the explicit mention of generative AI and large-scale models, along with traditional ML tasks, the 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile is the most fitting. The role is not purely AI specialist as it involves significant software engineering of a platform, nor is it purely AI-adjacent as it deals with the core model development lifecycle within the tool."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the nature of the tool being built (Canvas) and its purpose, as well as the extension into generative AI. It also mentions the need for model building and productionization experience. However, it could be more explicit about the specific generative AI techniques or models involved, and the balance between pure software engineering and AI specialization could be slightly clearer. The mention of 'Python' and 'microservices' are inferred from the context of ML platforms and Uber's tech stack, rather than explicitly stated in the provided snippet."
