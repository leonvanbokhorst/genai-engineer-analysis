While there are mentions of 'chatbot development' and 'working with generative AI' (1.B.2 and 1.B.1), these are presented as examples of the *types* of solutions the role might be involved with, rather than the primary focus of the role itself. The emphasis remains on the operational and engineering aspects of deploying and maintaining systems, which may include AI components. Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, as it involves supporting and enabling AI/ML features within a broader software engineering context."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly states 'DevOps Engineer' and lists many core DevOps responsibilities. The AI/GenAI mentions are examples of applications rather than the primary focus. The confidence is high, but not perfect (5), because the AI/GenAI mentions, while not central, are present and could imply a deeper involvement than just supporting infrastructure for them. However, the overall description strongly leans towards a DevOps role."
