        "rationale": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities for designing and developing ML/AI-based algorithms, specifically mentioning generative AI. It also includes a significant component of project management and leading programs, indicating a blend of AI specialization (Macro-Category B) and strategic/leadership tasks (Macro-Category A, though framed as project management here). The core focus is on developing AI solutions, with a specific mention of generative AI, and the project management aspect suggests a balanced role rather than purely a specialist. Therefore, 'Core GenAI Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the AI/ML and project management aspects. The mention of 'generative AI' is explicit. However, the specific tasks within 'Model Development & Fine-Tuning' or 'Prompt Engineering & RAG' are not detailed, and the 'Software Development & Integration' tasks are implied rather than explicitly stated as building production software. The project management aspect is also a significant part, which slightly dilutes the pure 'AI Specialist' focus but fits well within a 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile."
