While there's a mention of building tools and pipelines, the core focus is on the research and development of the models themselves, rather than integrating them into existing software products or managing production infrastructure. There are no explicit mentions of traditional software engineering tasks (Macro-Category A) like building user-facing applications or microservices. The role is research-oriented, focusing on model architectures, training processes, and evaluation, which aligns with a 'GenAI Specialist' profile."
