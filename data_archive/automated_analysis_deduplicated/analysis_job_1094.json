These tasks are predominantly from Macro-Category A. The core subject of these tasks involves Generative AI technologies (LLMs, GPT-4 Vision, CodeWhisperer). The role builds software that directly uses AI as a core part of its functionality, resulting in AI-powered features. There is no explicit mention of deep model development, fine-tuning, or advanced prompt engineering, which would indicate a more specialized AI role. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."
