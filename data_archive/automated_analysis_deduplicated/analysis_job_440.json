The tasks described are predominantly software engineering-focused, with AI playing a supportive or integrated role. The distinction between AI-Adjacent Software Engineer and other profiles is clear based on the provided description. A slightly lower score is given because while AI is mentioned, the specific types of AI tasks (e.g., model training, fine-tuning, specific GenAI frameworks) are not detailed, leaving some room for interpretation."
