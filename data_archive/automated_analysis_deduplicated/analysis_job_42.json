While it mentions interacting with an 'AI-powered platform' and developing a 'Generative AI tool' and an 'AI Chatbot', the core responsibilities and the primary technology (Go) are rooted in software engineering. The AI components appear to be features integrated into the broader software product rather than the primary focus of model development or deep GenAI specialization. Therefore, the role is classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly states the primary technology (Go) and many core software engineering responsibilities. The AI aspects are mentioned but not detailed in terms of specific AI/ML tasks like model training or fine-tuning. The confidence is high for the software engineering aspects, but slightly lower for the precise nature and depth of the AI integration, leading to a score of 4."
