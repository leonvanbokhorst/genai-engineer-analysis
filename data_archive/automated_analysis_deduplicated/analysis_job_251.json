While there is a mention of 'affinity for GenAI', there are no specific tasks or technologies listed that involve developing, integrating, or working directly with Generative AI models or frameworks. The role is purely within the software engineering domain of testing and quality assurance, aligning with the `Software Engineer` profile which requires tasks exclusively from Macro-Category A and does not involve building or integrating AI models."

The only slight ambiguity is the weight to give to the 'affinity for GenAI', which is not a core task. However, the explicit tasks and technologies strongly support the classification as a `Software Engineer`."
