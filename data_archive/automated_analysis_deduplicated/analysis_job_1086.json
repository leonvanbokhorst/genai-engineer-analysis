        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on creating, improving, troubleshooting, maintaining, and integrating AI technologies (LLMs, GPT-4 Vision, Amazon CodeWhisperer) into support platforms and workflows. While it involves AI technologies, the primary emphasis is on the software engineering aspects of building, testing, and supporting these systems within existing infrastructures (AWS). The tasks are predominantly from Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration), with a clear application of GenAI technologies. There is no indication of core model development or deep ML specialization, nor a balanced mix of A and B tasks specifically focused on GenAI model internals. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering tasks related to integrating and supporting AI technologies. The use of LLMs and specific AI tools is mentioned, but the core responsibilities lean towards building and maintaining the software infrastructure around them. The profile assignment is quite clear, but a slightly higher score could be achieved with more explicit detail on the 'creation' aspect of the LLM-powered platforms beyond just integration and support."
