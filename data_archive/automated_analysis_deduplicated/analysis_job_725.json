        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the responsibilities and the context of applying technology within the legal domain. However, it lacks specific technical details regarding the AI/ML tools or frameworks used, making it impossible to classify technologies. The focus is more on the application and integration of AI rather than its deep technical development. This leaves some room for interpretation regarding the depth of AI involvement, hence a score of 4."
