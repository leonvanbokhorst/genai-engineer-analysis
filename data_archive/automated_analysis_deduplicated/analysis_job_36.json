The tasks described fall under Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering), specifically within Operations & MLOps (1.A.2). There are no explicit tasks related to developing, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or data engineering for AI/ML models themselves (Macro-Category B). While it mentions collaborating with an AI team and supporting deep learning, the role's core responsibility is the infrastructure and platform, not the AI models themselves. Therefore, it aligns best with the 'Software Engineer' profile, which focuses exclusively on Macro-Category A tasks, even when those tasks support AI/ML initiatives."
