It explicitly states 'backend development', 'delivering product features', and 'developing backend APIs', all of which fall squarely into traditional software engineering. There is no ambiguity or mention of AI/ML components that would suggest a different profile. The mention of 'Go' as the primary language further solidifies the classification."
