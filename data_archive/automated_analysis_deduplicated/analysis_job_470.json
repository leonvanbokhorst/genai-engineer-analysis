        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on traditional ML tasks such as designing, developing, and implementing predictive models, algorithms (computer vision, regression, classification, optimization), and conducting experiments/proof-of-concepts. While there is a mention of integrating AI solutions into business processes (1.A.1), the core responsibilities (1.B.1) are predominantly in traditional ML model development. There are no specific mentions of Generative AI technologies like LLMs, RAG, or related frameworks. The soft skills identified (communication, learning) are general. Therefore, the profile of ML Specialist (Data Scientist) is the most fitting."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to traditional ML model development and experimentation. It also mentions integration and communication skills. However, it lacks specific technology mentions, which would have increased confidence. The distinction between traditional ML and GenAI is clear from the task descriptions, leading to a high but not perfect confidence score."
