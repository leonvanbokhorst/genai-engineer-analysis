While it mentions 'Big Data Analytics' and 'data challenges', there is no explicit mention of AI/ML model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. The role is about demonstrating and integrating a platform that *enables* data science and analytics, rather than performing core AI/ML engineering tasks. Therefore, it fits the profile of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

However, it lacks specific details about AI/ML technologies or tasks, making it difficult to definitively classify it within the AI/ML spectrum beyond 'Big Data Analytics'. The confidence is high for the software engineering aspects but moderate for the AI-adjacency due to the absence of explicit AI/ML terminology."
