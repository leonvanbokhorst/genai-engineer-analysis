While it mentions translating guidelines into 'machine learning algorithms' and staying updated on AI/ML research, these are presented as enhancements or integrations into existing processes rather than the core focus of building and training complex AI models from scratch. The primary output appears to be exam products that are enhanced by AI, not AI models themselves. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer role."

The AI aspects are mentioned but not as the primary focus of deep model development. The tasks are well-defined, allowing for a confident classification. A score of 4 reflects high confidence, with a slight deduction because the AI tasks are described in a way that could be interpreted slightly differently depending on the depth of 'translating guidelines into machine learning algorithms'."
