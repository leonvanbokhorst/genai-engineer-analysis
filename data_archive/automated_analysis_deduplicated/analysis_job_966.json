        "rationale": "The job advertisement focuses exclusively on tasks related to training and evaluating AI models, specifically generative AI models. Phrases like 'help train AI models', 'train AI large language models', 'Crafting and answering questions related to computer science in order to help train AI models', and 'Evaluating and ranking code generated by AI models' all fall under Macro-Category B: GenAI Specialization, specifically within 'Model Development & Fine-Tuning' (1.B.1). There are no tasks mentioned that fall under Macro-Category A: Core Software Engineering. The role is described as a 'Big Data Engineer for AI Training' and seeks 'talented coders to help train generative artificial intelligence models', indicating a specialization in the AI model development process rather than software integration or operations. Therefore, 'ML Specialist (Data Scientist)' is the most appropriate profile, with the understanding that the specialization is in Generative AI."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 5,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is very clear about the core tasks involved, which are directly related to training and evaluating AI models. While it mentions 'software engineer' in the introductory sentence, the detailed responsibilities clearly point to specialized AI model training activities. The absence of any software development or MLOps tasks makes the classification straightforward."
