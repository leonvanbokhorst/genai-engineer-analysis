While it mentions exploring GenAI, LLM, and Copilots, there are no specific tasks related to developing, fine-tuning, or implementing these AI models themselves (Macro-Category B). The core responsibilities are centered around building and maintaining the underlying infrastructure and deployment processes, rather than the AI components. Therefore, it aligns best with the 'Software Engineer' profile, specifically one focused on cloud and DevOps."

The mention of GenAI, LLM, and Copilots is in the context of 'exploring new technologies' rather than core job duties. This makes the classification as 'Software Engineer' quite confident, but not a perfect 5 due to the slight ambiguity introduced by the mention of exploring AI technologies."
