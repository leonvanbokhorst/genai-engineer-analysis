There is no mention of AI/ML model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, RAG, or any specific AI/ML technologies. The mention of 'AI' in the title appears to be in the context of the software being used for automation and AI-related tasks within the NX CAM domain, rather than the role itself being focused on AI development. Therefore, it fits the 'Software Engineer' profile."
