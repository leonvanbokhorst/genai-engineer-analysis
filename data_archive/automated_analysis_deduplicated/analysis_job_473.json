While it involves Generative AI, the focus is on enabling data teams and managing the platform, rather than deep model development or specialized GenAI tasks like prompt engineering. The role acts as a technical focal point and leader for the Generative AI platform, supporting others in building solutions, which aligns with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile that builds or maintains software that directly uses or supports AI/ML models as a core part of its functionality."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities that lean heavily towards software engineering and platform management, with Generative AI as the domain. The title 'Generative AI Engineer' might suggest a deeper AI specialization, but the responsibilities described are more aligned with enabling and integrating AI capabilities within a broader software engineering context. The mention of 'Azure OpenAI infrastructure' provides a specific technology context. The confidence is high, but not perfect, as there's a slight ambiguity in whether 'designing, developing, and implementing Generative AI models' implies deep model work or more of an engineering approach to deploying and managing them."
