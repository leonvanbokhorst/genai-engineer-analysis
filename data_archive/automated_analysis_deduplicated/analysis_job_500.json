        "rationale": "The job description heavily emphasizes traditional full-stack development tasks, including building backend services (Python, FastAPI), front-end UIs (React/Redux), and integrating various components. While it mentions 'generative AI capabilities' and 'conversational technology', the core responsibilities and the majority of the tasks described fall under 'Software Development & Integration' (Macro-Category A). The role is about building and maintaining a digital assistant that *uses* AI, rather than focusing on the AI model development or specialization itself. Therefore, it fits the profile of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

The mention of AI is in the context of integration into an existing product, aligning well with the AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile. The language is unambiguous."
