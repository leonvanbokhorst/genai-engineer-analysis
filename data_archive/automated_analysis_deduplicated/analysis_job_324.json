There are no mentions of software development, integration, or operations (Macro-Category A). The tasks are specific to AI model interaction and improvement, aligning with the 'GenAI Specialist' profile which is predominantly focused on tasks from Macro-Category B and specifically Generative AI."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is very specific about the tasks involved, which are clearly related to AI model training and evaluation. However, it lacks detail on the specific AI models or technologies used, and it doesn't mention any software engineering aspects, making the profile assignment straightforward but not a perfect 5."
