        "rationale": "The job ad heavily emphasizes traditional software engineering tasks (design, develop, maintain, improve scalability, C# development) which fall under Macro-Category A. While 'GenAI' is mentioned as a focus area for the Channels team, the core responsibilities of the Principal Developer are centered around leading and developing the overall product, which is AI-powered. The role is not focused on the deep technical aspects of GenAI model development or prompt engineering itself, but rather on integrating and leading the development of an AI-powered product. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines core software engineering responsibilities and leadership. The mention of 'GenAI' as a focus area for one of the teams provides context for the AI aspect, but the primary duties of the Principal Developer are rooted in software engineering leadership. The profile assignment is clear, but a slightly lower score is given because the depth of AI involvement is not as explicit as in a 'Core GenAI Engineer' role."
