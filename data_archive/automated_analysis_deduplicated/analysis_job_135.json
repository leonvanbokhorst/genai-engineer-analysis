        "rationale": "The job description primarily focuses on customer service operations, strategy, and the integration/improvement of customer service tools (Macro-Category A tasks). While it mentions 'generative AI' as a technology to innovate with, the core responsibilities are not about developing or fine-tuning AI models themselves, nor are they focused on prompt engineering or RAG. The role is about leveraging technology, including potentially AI, to enhance customer service operations and integrate solutions, making it an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer role."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to customer service operations, strategy, and tool integration. The mention of 'generative AI' is in the context of innovation within customer service, not as a core development task. The tasks lean heavily towards business strategy and software integration rather than deep AI model work. The profile assignment is straightforward based on this distribution."
