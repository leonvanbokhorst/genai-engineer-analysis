It also mentions working with AI and LLM models (Macro-Category B), but the core focus appears to be on integrating or utilizing these technologies within a software development context rather than deep model development or specialization. The role is described as a 'technical link' and contributing to 'shaping the company', suggesting the AI/LLM aspect is a feature integrated into the software engineering role."

While it mentions Python and LLM models, the core responsibilities are described in general software engineering terms. This makes it difficult to definitively classify the depth of AI involvement. The profile assignment is based on the emphasis on software development and the general mention of AI/LLM."
