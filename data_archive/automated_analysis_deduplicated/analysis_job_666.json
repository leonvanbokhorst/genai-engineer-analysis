While it mentions leveraging generative AI and creating educational content using it, these are presented as features integrated into the products rather than the core focus of model development or deep AI research. The role is described as a 'Full Stack Engineer' and the AI aspect is about enhancing existing products and boosting engineer productivity. There's no indication of deep model training, fine-tuning, or specialized prompt engineering as the primary responsibility. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile, where the core is software engineering, augmented by AI integration."

The technologies listed are primarily for full-stack development. The AI aspect is present but not the sole or dominant focus, making the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile a strong fit. A slightly lower score is given because the 'Educational Content Generation' task could lean slightly towards AI specialization, but the overall emphasis remains on software development."
