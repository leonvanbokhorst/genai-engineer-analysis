While there is a mention of 'exploring integrations with Dify for LLM capabilities', this is a minor aspect compared to the extensive software development responsibilities. The role is about building and maintaining the e-commerce platform, which happens to integrate AI features, rather than focusing on AI model development or specialization. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

The profile assignment is straightforward based on this balance. A slightly lower score is given because the AI aspect is 'exploring' rather than a defined core responsibility, leaving a small room for interpretation on the depth of AI involvement."
