        "rationale": "The job advertisement only provides the title 'Senior Back End Developer'. This title strongly implies responsibilities falling under Macro-Category A: Core Software Engineering. Without any mention of AI, ML, Generative AI, LLMs, or related technologies or tasks, it is not possible to classify this role as involving AI/ML specializations. Therefore, the most appropriate profile based on the limited information is 'Software Engineer', as it signifies a role focused exclusively on core software engineering tasks without AI/ML integration."

        "score": 1,
        "reasoning": "The job advertisement is extremely minimal, containing only the job title. This provides insufficient information to perform a detailed analysis of tasks, technologies, or soft skills. The profile assignment is based solely on the interpretation of the job title, making the analysis highly speculative."
