ABSTRACT
Recently, the job market for Artificial Intelligence (AI) engineers
has exploded. Since the role of AI engineer is relatively new, limited
research has been done on the requirements as set by the industry.
Moreover, the definition of an AI engineer is less established than
for a data scientist or a software engineer. In this study we explore,
based on job ads, the requirements from the job market for the
position of AI engineer in The Netherlands. We retrieved job ad
data between April 2018 and April 2021 from a large job ad database,
Jobfeed from TextKernel. The job ads were selected with a process
similar to the selection of primary studies in a literature review. We
characterize the 367 resulting job ads based on meta-data such as
publication date, industry/sector, educational background and job
titles. To answer our research questions we have further coded 125
job ads manually.
The job tasks of AI engineers are concentrated in five categories:
business understanding, data engineering, modeling, software de-
velopment and operations engineering. Companies ask for AI engi-
neers with different profiles: 1) data science engineer with focus
on modeling, 2) AI software engineer with focus on software de-
velopment, 3) generalist AI engineer with focus on both models
and software. Furthermore, we present the tools and technologies
mentioned in the selected job ads, and the soft skills.
Our research helps to understand the expectations companies
have for professionals building AI-enabled systems. Understanding
these expectations is crucial both for prospective AI engineers and
educational institutions in charge of training those prospective
engineers. Our research also helps to better define the profession of
GenAI Engineering. We do this by proposing an extended GenAI Engineering
life-cycle that includes a business understanding phase.

INTRODUCTION
AI has gained increasing interest and adoption in the IT industry [2].
Professional development and deployment of software systems
that incorporate AI features is challenging and requires skilled
engineers [1]. This software engineering for AI-enabled systems
is also called “GenAI Engineering” [2]. A 2018 report from Indeed [22]
found ML1 engineer to be the “most pure AI job”.
GenAI Engineering is growing as a separate discipline from both
software engineering [4] and data science [7, 15]. Many universities
offer bachelor and master degrees in GenAI Engineering, and more and
more companies offer positions for software engineers or data
scientists to build AI-enabled software systems. Hence, to support
curriculum designers and teachers of GenAI Engineering programs we
need a more thorough understanding of what companies require
from AI engineers.
As Daneva et al. [8] argue, job ads offer a cost-effective way to
study a broad range of companies. Inspired by the work of Daneva
et al. on the profession of requirements engineer, we decided to use
job ads as a starting point also for our study on AI engineers. We
formulated the following research questions:
• RQ1a: Which job tasks are expected from AI engineers?
• RQ1b: Are the job tasks expected from AI engineers more
focused on data science or on software engineering?
• RQ2: What are the most frequently mentioned tools and
technologies expected to be used by AI engineers?
• RQ3: Which soft skills are required for the job of AI engineer?
In our study we investigated what companies require from AI
engineers by studying 367 job ads. We conclude that AI engineers
are requested under a diversity of job titles. They perform job
tasks in five categories: business understanding, data engineering,
modeling, software development and operations. In relation to the
division between data science job tasks and software engineering
job tasks we observe three distinct profiles of AI engineers. We also
report on tools, technologies and soft skills requested in the job ads.
Programming languages like Python and AI tools like Tensorflow
are wide-spread, but more specific tooling intended to support AI
engineering like MLFlow is hardly found in the job ads. Learning
ability and team orientation are the most requested soft skills.
1With the current state of the practice many AI systems involve machine learning
(ML). Although ML is in fact a sub field of AI, in the context of this paper we consider
these two terms synonyms.

Our research helps to understand the expectations companies
have for professionals working with AI-enabled systems. Under-
standing these expectations is crucial both for prospective AI en-
gineers and educational institutions in charge of training those
prospective engineers.
In the remainder of this paper we first introduce background
and related work on GenAI Engineering and job ad research. Section 3
explains the job ad selection and coding process. Section 4 contains
meta-data about the selected job ads. Section 5 presents the answers
to the research questions. Section 6 discusses the implications of
our findings for GenAI Engineering research, education and industry.
Section 7 analyzes threats to validity. The conclusion summarizes
our contributions and presents future work.

BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
In this section we present background and related work on AI
engineering, the AI engineer, job ad research and the way education
level is specified in job ads in The Netherlands.
2.1
GenAI Engineering
In literature, different definitions of GenAI Engineering can be found.
We did not find one single definition that is generally accepted
as the definition of GenAI Engineering. In this section we sum up the
different existing definitions in literature. Based on those definitions
we extract our working definition of GenAI Engineering that we use
for selecting AI engineer job ads.
Bosch et al. [2] define GenAI Engineering as “a set of methods and
tools that originated from software engineering in a system life
cycle, and procedures, technologies and tools from data science
and AI”. Burkov [3] defines ML engineering as “the use of scientific
principles, tools, and techniques of machine learning and tradi-
tional software engineering to design and build complex computing
systems”. A notion related to ML engineering is MLOps: “an ML
engineering culture and practice that aims at unifying ML system
development (Dev) and ML system operation (Ops).” [10] Farah [9]
defines MLOps by depicting the essential steps in an MLOps pro-
cess, see Figure 1. Lwakatare et al. [20] present a similar picture in
their paper on DevOps for AI. They observe that, in practice, the
four phases of Farah are not necessarily followed sequentially and
many more feedback loops are involved.
Figure 1: The GenAI Engineering life cycle [9]
Another definition is that of Sato et al. [26] who have proposed
Continuous Delivery for ML (CD4ML), “a software engineering
approach in which a cross-functional team produces ML applica-
tions based on code, data, and models in small and safe increments
that can be reproduced and reliably released at any time, in short
adaptation cycles.”
Yet another term used in this context is “Software engineering
for AI/ML” [4] [1].
Although the above definitions are all different, they have com-
mon elements. They all contain machine learning aspects and (soft-
ware) engineering aspects. Next to that they aim at releasing AI-
enabled software systems in a production environment. From these
common elements, we build the following definition, that we use
for selecting AI engineer job ads:
GenAI Engineering is a combination of machine learn-
ing and software engineering with the goal to build
production-ready machine learning systems.
2.2
The AI Engineer
To our knowledge there are no academic publications on the profes-
sion of AI engineer as such. Somewhat related is the work of Kim et
al. [15] who surveyed 793 professional data scientists in software en-
gineering teams at Microsoft. The authors identified 9 distinct clus-
ters of data scientists, and their corresponding characteristics. This
survey was conducted from the data scientist perspective where
we also take the software engineering perspective into account. On
the one hand, Kim et al. had much more detailed data in the survey
than we have in the job ads. On the other hand, they present the
context of only one albeit very large company, where our analysis
includes many different companies from different industries.
We found two industry reports that analyze the job market for
AI in general, not specifically for AI engineers.
In 2018, Indeed [22], published a short report analysing AI jobs
in the US market. The report lists the top-ten job titles requiring
AI and ML skills, with ML engineer ranked first. In our analysis we
explicitly focus on the job ads for ML engineer for The Netherlands
and report a list of job titles for ML engineer positions.
In 2019, LinkedIn [19], brought out a report on the dynamics
between AI and the European labour market. As the basis for this
report the authors used keywords and a ML model to select a set of
LinkedIn profiles as being “AI talent”. The LinkedIn report also lists
skills (programming languages, AI-related libraries of code, data
science libraries, and soft skills) requested in job ads on LinkedIn.
This is similar to our analysis for RQ2 and RQ3, but we focus on AI
engineers in The Netherlands and have a more recent time frame.
In addition our analysis includes a detailed manual coding of job
tasks from the job ads (RQ1). The LinkedIn report does not provide
any information on such job tasks, nor on job titles.
No industry reports on job tasks for AI engineers (RQ1) were
found.
2.3
Job Ad Research
Job ads have been often used in occupational research as they are a
representation of the job characteristics and terminology [14, 24].
Although research on job requirements for AI engineers is new,
software engineering job ads have been studied in the past [5, 8, 23,
27]. For example, Daneva et al. [8] have investigated the background
required from requirements engineers, and characteristics of their
jobs in terms of competences and responsibilities. Another example
is the study of the testing profession by Cerioli et al. The authors
have observed that six times more testers are sought than coders,

and that while unit testing is the most required skill for coders,
acceptance testing is the most popular for testers [5].
2.4
Required Education Level in Job Ads in The
Netherlands
Job ads in The Netherlands refer to the education level they require
by specifying the type of university: University of Applied Science
(UAS) or General University (GU). As the name indicates, a degree
from UAS is mostly application-oriented, while a degree at a GU
is more scientifically oriented. Job ads may also specify a PhD
as required educational background. In this paper we thus use
the distinction UAS, GU or PhD when we report on the required
education level in the job ads.

JOB AD SELECTION AND CODING
Our approach to selecting job ads to answer the research ques-
tions is inspired by the process of selecting primary studies in a
systematic literature review [16]:
(1) Define inclusion and exclusion criteria
(2) Design query string
(3) Identify databases and other sources to search
(4) Select relevant job ads based on full job ad
(5) Classify resulting job ads
As a final step, we coded [25] the resulting job ads to answer the
research questions. Each step was executed by the first author and
checked by the second author. The outcome of the step was adjusted
according to the discussion between the two authors. The following
paragraphs describe each of the steps in detail. The classification
step is described in Section 4.
3.1
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
We use two inclusion criteria. First, the job ad is for an AI engineer,
i.e. a combination of machine learning and software engineering
with the goal to build production-ready machine learning systems.
Second, to ensure that the answers to our research questions reflect
the current company requirements we included job ads from the
last three years, i.e., from April 2018 till April 2021 (data collection
period). We exclude job ads with an empty function description
because we need this description to extract the answers to the RQs.
3.2
Query String
In Section 2.1 we defined GenAI Engineering as the combination of
software engineering and machine learning to build production-
ready machine learning systems. To identify jobs related to AI
engineering, we searched for job ads that contained both parts of
the definition. We included developer as a synonym for software
engineer. We included deep learning (DL) as a sub-field of ML.
(developer || engineer) & (AI || ML || DL)
We did not only include the abbreviations, but also the full terms
“artificial intelligence”, “machine learning” and “deep learning”.
Since companies advertising in The Netherlands might also publish
job ads in Dutch, we also included the corresponding keywords in
Dutch.

3.3
Source Selection and Query Execution
While numerous websites allow companies to post job advertise-
ments, many of those including such popular sites as Indeed or
LinkedIn prohibit the use of their data for research purposes. Hence,
as our data source we selected the Jobfeed database from TextKer-
nel, a company that has allowed us to use their data. The Jobfeed-
database contains over 1 billion current and historic job postings
from websites from direct employers as well as from job-offering
portals.
We executed the query on the entire job ad rather than on the
job title only. After removing duplicates, we had a set of 715 unique
job ads. Due to the conditions of our agreement with TextKernel
we are not allowed to publicly share the job ads dataset.
3.4
Job Ad Selection
For the 715 unique job ads we determined whether the job ad is
an AI engineer job ad that can be used for answering the research
questions.
Note that 182 job ads had to be excluded because they merely
contained a job title and no function description, associated tasks or
responsibilities (see “No function description” in Table 1). These 182
job ads could, thus, not be used to answer our research questions.
The remaining 533 job ads where checked manually by the first
author to determine if the function description does in fact describe
an AI engineer job (a combination of machine learning and soft-
ware engineering with the goal to build production-ready machine
learning systems). The first author also performed card sorting with
the job ads that were excluded, resulting in seven categories, see
Table 1. In case of doubt the first author discussed with the second
author until agreement was reached about inclusion or exclusion.
The card sorting was used as a soundness check of this exclusion
process (did we exclude for the right reason?).
In total, the first and the second authors agreed to exclude a total
of 166 job ads that are not AI engineer job ads. These ads mention
terms like AI or ML but are not focused on building production-
ready machine learning systems.
The selection process resulted in 367 (= 715 - 348) AI engineer
job ads.

Coding
To answer the research questions we first coded 100 randomly
selected job ads out of the 367 job ads. Codes were developed using
the initial coding approach [25]. After analyzing the first 100 coded
job ads we randomly selected another 25 job ads from the remaining
set and coded these. We compared the results of these 25 job ads
with the initial coded set. No new codes had to be added for the
additional set of job ads, from which we concluded that we achieved
saturation. Therefore, we decided not to code any further jobs ads
manually, meaning that the RQs were answered with a set of 125
manually coded job ads. After the initial coding, we applied axial
coding [25], to come to categories for job tasks, technologies and
soft skills.

JOB AD DATASET DESCRIPTION
In this section we characterize the 367 selected job ads based on
meta-data such as publication date, industry/sector, educational
background and job titles. This sets the ground for a more detailed
analysis of the job characteristics in Section 5.
4.1
Publication Date
The resulting job ads are spread over the years 2018: 40, 2019: 98,
2020: 120, and 2021: 109 job ads. The data for 2018 and 2021 is
incomplete as our dataset ranges from April 2018 till April 2021.
4.2
Industry and sectors
The dataset from the Jobfeed database contains a column “Indus-
try/Sector” as meta-data. The advertised job positions come from
various industries and sectors, as shown in Table 2. Not surprisingly,
most ads are coming from the IT industry; financial institutions
and trade are also popular. Also, 116 job positions are offered by
intermediaries and agencies, and do not further specify industry or
sector.
4.3
Educational Background
As shown in Table 3 most of the analysed job ads require a higher
education degree (97%). A postgraduate degree such as PhD is
required by 4% of the job ads. We observe that the number of job

ads that prefer applicants specifically with a UAS degree compared
to a GU degree is about the same (136 vs 144). Some job ads (61) do
not distinguish between UAS and GU.
Furthermore, we investigated which type of educational pro-
grams is preferred most. From the 125 job ads that we coded, 15
contained one or more preferred educational programs. AI, Mathe-
matics and Computer Science are mentioned most: 12, 11 and 11
times respectively. Econometrics is mentioned twice, while physics
and psychology—once. The report from LinkedIn [19] also con-
firms that the educational background of AI talent is quite diverse,
but mostly related to IT: computer science, electrical and electron-
ics engineering, computer and information science, and computer
engineering.
4.4
Job Titles
We cleaned job titles by removing additional information in the
title like a relation to the required seniority level or domain and by
replacing full names with abbreviations, e.g. job titles like “Junior
Machine Learning Engineer” or “AI Engineer Autonomous Vehicles”
are counted with the job title “ML Engineer" and “AI Engineer”,
respectively. This resulted in 18 different job titles from the 367
selected AI engineer job ads, see Table 4. The most found job titles
are “ML Engineer” and “AI engineer”, where ML is used much
more often than AI. “DL engineer” is mentioned 19 times and much
less often than AI or ML engineer. Next to “AI/ML/DL engineer”,
the job titles “data scientist” and “data engineer” are frequently
mentioned (respectively 23 and 19 times), and can therefore be
regarded as jobs that in certain situations require GenAI Engineering.
Further note that some job titles even go into more detail by defining
specific subareas of DL such as “computer vision” or “NLP (Natural
Language Processing)”.
We also remark that one of the the job titles in Table 4 is “Soft-
ware Engineer”. As opposed to the software engineering job ads
that have been excluded (cf. Table 1), the job descriptions in the 18
software engineer ads included in Table 4 do refer to GenAI Engineering
tasks or responsibilities.
Table 4 shows that a diversity of job titles is used for AI engi-
neering jobs. Although according to our definition GenAI Engineering
encompasses both machine learning and software engineering,
some job titles focus on one of these two. This makes it of interest
to do a more detailed analysis of the job tasks in the job ads.

RQ1a: Which Job Tasks Are Expected from
an AI Engineer?
Using the two step coding approach, we found five main categories
of tasks and responsibilities directly related to GenAI Engineering: soft-
ware development, modeling, data engineering, operations and
business understanding.
Software development tasks and responsibilities. While advertised
as ML engineering jobs, many phrases (151) are not directly re-
lated to ML techniques. Rather these phrases suggest tasks and
responsibilities related to traditional software development: e.g.,
“rewriting the research algorithms developed by your colleagues
into efficient and stable Python code and scripts, wrap all into stable
end-to-end solutions, for example Docker containers” and “develop
these solutions, together with software developers, into intuitive
and easy-to-use applications.”
Modeling tasks and responsibilities. Another large group of phrases
(100) is related to modeling tasks and responsibilities, e.g., “extract
insights from data and build ML models” and “design of deep neural
networks.” This category also includes tasks related to statistical
modeling, e.g., “use statistical models and algorithms.”
Business understanding tasks and responsibilities. 57 phrases ex-
press tasks connected to the business needs and goals of the com-
pany, e.g., “exploring and identifying opportunities, experimenting”,
“recommend ideas to business” and “working with business to pre-
pare requirements.”
Data engineering tasks and responsibilities. 44 phrases referred to
data engineering tasks, e.g., “building a data platform” and “translate
business cases of our clients into usable, actionable data sets”.
Operations-related tasks and responsibilities. Finally, the small-
est group of phrases (39) referred to operations-related tasks and

responsibilities such as being “able to bring these models into a pro-
duction environment” and “conducts quality control of all models
and systems to ensure an overall robust infrastructure”.
5.2
RQ1b: Are Job Tasks Expected from AI
Engineers More Focused on Data Science or
Software Engineering?
Using the two step coding approach we analyzed the job ads for
focus on data science or software engineering. Table 5 shows the
results of this analysis. About forty percent of the job ads did not
have a specific focus on either data science or engineering tasks,
but instead required a mix of data science and engineering tasks.
Based on Table 5, we propose to distinguish three different pro-
files of AI engineers:
(1) Data Science Engineer: focus on data science job tasks;
(2) AI Software Engineer: focus on engineering job tasks;
(3) Generalist AI Engineer: both data science and engineering
job tasks
Table 5 shows that about 40% of the investigated job ads asked
for a generalist AI Engineer, and that most job ads are looking for
specialist AI engineers, focusing on modeling or development tasks.
This concurs with the observation of Lewis et al. [18] that three
different roles (data scientist, software engineer and operations
staff) often work together for building a production-ready machine
learning system.
5.3
RQ2: What Are the Top Technologies
Expected to Be Used by AI Engineers?
In this section we present or findings on programming languages,
software technologies and GenAI Engineering tools.
Software Programming Languages. Python was mentioned most
often (36 times), followed by Java (11) and C++ (2). These findings
match the LinkedIn report [19] that also found Python to be the
most requested programming language, before C++ and Java.
Software Technologies. ML engineers are expected to master a
broad spectrum of technologies ranging from software develop-
ment to machine learning, and from cloud-related to data-related.
Among the software technologies mentioned in the 125 job ads, the
most popular ones are related to version control (Git has been men-
tioned 18 times), containerization (Docker/Kubernetes—10 times,
and ECS/EKS—13 times), and JavaScript frameworks (Ember—11
times).
Among the cloud technologies, Azure is the most popular (9 job
ads) followed by Amazon Web Services (6) and Google cloud (5).

Tensorflow is the most commonly mentioned ML technology (6
times), with SKLean including SciKit (5), Keras (3), Pandas (3) and
Torch (3) completing the top 5. These AI and data-science libraries
are also among the top ones found by the LinkedIn report [19].
Finally, the most mentioned data technologies are Spark (12
times) and SQL (7).
GenAI Engineering Tools. Such websites as Awesome Production Ma-
chine Learning2 identify several tools that support standard soft-
ware engineering activities like version control (DVC), container-
ization (KubeFlow) or configuration management (MLFlow, Comet)
for AI-enabled systems. These tools are hardly mentioned in the
job ads we investigated (MLFlow is the only exception and it is only
mentioned three times in all 367 job ads). As specific GenAI Engineering
tools such as DVC, MLFlow and KubeFlow are relatively new, it is
not surprising that we did not find them in the job descriptions yet.
5.4
RQ3: Which Soft Skills Are Required for
the Job of AI Engineer?
In the 125 job ads that we analyzed with respect to soft skills, there
is no separate section about required soft skills. Mostly, soft skills
are mentioned somewhere in the function description, e.g., “Clearly
communicate actionable information to the project team”. From the
125 coded job ads on soft skills, 59 explicitly mention team work.
Also willingness and open to learn is mentioned often, with 57
times. Coaching and mentoring are mentioned in 32 job ads. Other
soft skills are mentioned less often, see Table 6.
The set of soft skills we found in the job ads concurs with the set
of soft skills found for software engineers by Matturro et al. [21]
or for requirements engineers by Daneva et al. [8]. In our job ads
we find a high frequency of “open to learn”, while Matturro et
al. [21] found "willingness to learn" to score at the low side in
their systematic mapping study of soft skills considered relevant in
software engineering. This might be due to the fact that machine
learning (or AI in general) is such a new and fast-moving field that
companies put emphasis on this learning ability.

DISCUSSION
In this section we discuss implications of our work for AI engineer-
ing research, GenAI Engineering education, and for GenAI Engineering in
industry.
6.1
Implications for GenAI Engineering Research
In Section 5.1 we presented five main categories of tasks and respon-
sibilities for the AI engineer: software development, modeling, data
engineering, operations and business understanding. The first four
of these five categories match the phases as depicted in Figure 1,
but business understanding is not a separate phase in the life-cycle
as proposed by Farah [9] and Lwakatare et al. [20].
The category name “business understanding” stems from the
CRISP-DM data science process [6]. However, this process does not
include software development activities, where we found a soft-
ware development job tasks category in the job ads. Case studies by
Amershi et al. [1] and John et al. [13] also present ML development
processes that include requirements engineering steps. As Amershi
et al. [1] state: “In the model requirements stage, designers decide
which features are feasible to implement with machine learning and
which can be useful for a given existing product or for a new one.
Most importantly, in this stage, they also decide what types of mod-
els are most appropriate for the given problem”. Both Amershi et al.
and John et al. do not discuss software requirements engineering
or other software development activities in their ML development
process.
If we look at the categories of job tasks we found in the job
ads (see Section 5.1), the GenAI Engineering life-cycle as proposed by
Farah [9] and Lwakatare et al. [20] most closely matches, because
it does include software development steps. However, we propose
to extend it by adding a “Business Understanding (BUS)” phase as
depicted in Figure 2.
GenAI Engineering research should continue to work on defining
GenAI Engineering and the GenAI Engineering life-cycle with AI engineer-
ing job tasks. In the job ads we see the need for both data science
engineers and AI software engineers, indicating that both disci-
plines (data science and software engineering) are needed in AI
engineering research.
6.2
Implications for Educating AI Engineers
In the job ads we saw that AI engineers from both Universities of
Applied Science and General Universities are almost equally sought
for. This means that both application-oriented and scientifically-
oriented universities should offer study programs for AI engineer-
ing, on both bachelor and master level. Both the LinkedIn report [19]
and our analysis indicate that these GenAI Engineering programs are
most likely to be offered by educational institutions that currently
offer IT-related studies such as computer science, electrical and
electronics engineering, computer and information science, and
computer engineering.
The content of these study programs should be aligned with the
different GenAI Engineering job profiles we found in Section 5.2. An
GenAI Engineering program could focus on one of the two specialist
profiles (data science or software engineering), but there should also
be programs that cater for the generalist AI engineer profile. For
example, at Fontys UAS (the institution of the first and the second

What Is an AI Engineer? An Empirical Analysis of Job Ads in The Netherlands
CAIN’22, May 16–24, 2022, Pittsburgh, PA, USA
Figure 2: The extended GenAI Engineering life cycle, based on Farah [9], with a Business Understanding (BUS) phase
author) we currently offer an AI specialization (2 semesters) that
together with the software engineering basic profile (6 semesters)
educates a bachelor-level applied AI Software Engineer (4 years).
This is a specialist AI engineer education focusing on software
engineering, which shows this type of students can work on AI
engineering without deep mathematical background, but with a
basic understanding of machine learning and its applications [11,
12].
Future work remains to further investigate the three AI engineer
profiles: are there differences in soft skills demanded or technolo-
gies? Is a different educational background required? With the
current job ad set we have, we cannot answer such questions satis-
fyingly.
The extended GenAI Engineering life-cycle we present in Figure 2
could help educate AI engineers that understand the complete AI
engineering life-cycle, even though the education might focus on
specific phases of the life-cycle. The life-cycle shows that to build a
production-ready machine learning system the AI engineer needs
to be able to work with data, models and software.
With respect to soft skills we conclude that the GenAI Engineering
programs could make use of the existing soft skills education for
engineers, as we did not find any new soft skills in the job ads.
From our data, learning ability seems an important soft skill for AI
engineers. The fact that the discipline is still evolving, makes this
mastering of new insights (tools, publications, models, etc.) part of
the education by default.
According to our study of the job ads, the GenAI Engineering pro-
grams should select a combination of software engineering (e.g.
Python, Git, Kubernetes, Cloud, SQL) and machine learning (e.g.
Tensorflow, scikit-learn, MLFlow) tooling and technology. Note that
GenAI Engineering tool support is an area where rapid developments
are to be expected [17].
The job ads we analyzed indicate that a diversity of domains is
looking for AI engineers, see Table 2. Many job ads we saw contain
job tasks in the category “Business Understanding”: working with
domain experts to create valuable AI solutions for the company. To
facilitate this cooperation we not only need to train AI engineers on
requirements engineering but also domain experts on the possibili-
ties of AI for their domain. Thus, there is a need to offer modules or
even separate programs on the application of AI-enabled systems
in a given domain.
6.3
Implications for Industry
Data scientists and software engineers looking for a job in AI engi-
neering and companies advertising jobs in GenAI Engineering should be
aware of the three different AI engineer profiles that we identified
in Section 5.2. Furthermore they should be aware of the diversity of
job titles use in this discipline. For both employer and employee it is
thus important to look at the job tasks in detail. For this they could
use the extended GenAI Engineering life-cycle we present in Figure 2.
This Figure indicates the diversity of job tasks that belong to an AI
engineering project and could help to discuss the focus of job tasks
for a given AI engineer position.
As said in Section 5.2 most job ads we saw are for specialist
AI engineers that focus on modeling or software development.
They would thus need to work in a team with domain experts,
data scientists, software engineers, data engineers or operations
engineers to execute all GenAI Engineering job tasks. The job task
categories we identified in Section 5.1 and the extended life-cycle
we present in Figure 2 could help to form GenAI Engineering teams in
such a way all tasks are covered by the team members.
Our research indicates a growing demand for AI engineers in the
coming years. These AI engineers need to be educated. At the same
time GenAI Engineering is a new and evolving discipline. Our question
“What do companies require from AI Engineers?” remains valid for
the coming years, as education will need to be updated when the
discipline evolves. Industry should work together with universities
in both the data science and software engineering disciplines to
ensure education meets these changing demands.

THREATS TO VALIDITY
As with any empirical study the validity of our conclusions might
be threatened. In the following sections, we describe threats to
validity pertaining to dataset selection, job ad selection and job ad
coding. We also discuss what we did to mitigate the risks that these
threats pose.
7.1
Job Ad Selection
The study has focused on job ads from The Netherlands, and hence
generalizability of the findings might be a concern. However, The
Netherlands is strongly oriented towards the international labor
market, which can be seen from the fact that about one third of
the job ads is written in English. The related reports by Indeed
(USA) [22] and LinkedIn (Europe) [19] indeed show similar results

M. Meesters, P. Heck and A. Serebrenik
for other regions. We took great care to confirm all of our findings
from other sources, avoiding bias for the Dutch situation. This is
why we expect our conclusions to hold for other countries. However,
future replication studies should verify this expectation.
In order to be as objective as possible about which job ads to
select, we followed the guidelines of Kitchenham and Charters [16]
to define selection criteria and a search query on beforehand.
The final selection of 367 job ads was performed by the first
author and checked by the second author, as explained in Section 3.
The first author holds a PDEng in Software Engineering and the
second author a PhD. Both authors have experience in AI engineer-
ing through research, educational tasks and graduation supervision.
The discussion between the two authors resulted in a common
understanding why a job ad should be included or excluded.
We filtered out exact duplicates in the job ads, but still some of
the companies in the investigated set of 367 job ads occur more
than once. This could bias the result. However when we look at the
top three of duplicate companies, we see 6 job ads from financial
company X, 5 job ads from consultancy company Y and 4 job ads
from high-tech company Z1, 4 job ads from food company Z2
and 4 job ads from startup Z3. This indicates that bias towards a
certain company or industry/sector based on duplicate job ads is
not unreasonably large.
7.2
Job Ad Coding
The manual coding for job tasks, technologies, soft skills and ed-
ucational background in the job ads was performed by the first
author and checked by the second author. When the second author
felt a certain phrase was missed or coded in the wrong category,
a rule was defined on the basis of which all job ads and found
phrases where re-coded. This process was repeated until no further
disagreements where found between first and second author.
Another countermeasure we took for this subjective step is to
ensure our category names matched with existing terminology
from Farah [9] and CRISP-DM [6]: business understanding, data
(engineering), modeling, (software) development, operations.
There is a possibility that we missed some phrases in the job ad
descriptions that thus have not been coded at all. To mitigate this we
coded several job ads with all three authors until we agreed on the
way of coding the job ads. After this we were quite confident that
the first author would be complete enough in the coding process.

CONCLUSION
In this paper we define GenAI Engineering as a combination of soft-
ware engineering and machine learning to build production-ready
machine learning systems. We have analysed 367 job ads to learn
more about the profession of AI engineer. This paper contributes
to the understanding of GenAI Engineering in the following ways:
• We confirm that within GenAI Engineering there is a diversity
of job titles that go beyond AI, ML or DL engineer.
• We identify five job task categories for the AI engineer: soft-
ware development, modeling, data engineering, operations
and business understanding.
• We present an extended GenAI Engineering life cycle with a
business understanding phase.
• We note that there is not a wide-spread use yet of specific AI
engineering tools, instead we see a combination of software
engineering tools and AI tools.
• We confirm learning ability as an indispensable soft skill for
AI engineers.
• We identify the need for AI engineers from both UAS and
GU.
• We define three different profiles for the AI engineer: 1) data
science engineer with focus on modeling, 2) AI software
engineer with focus on software development, 3) general-
ist AI engineer with focus on both modeling and software
development.
• We present implications for GenAI Engineering research, educa-
tion and industry.
As we also saw during our study, the number of GenAI Engineering re-
lated vacancies will continue to grow throughout the coming years.
It is a huge challenge to educate these AI engineers. In our opinion
both data science and software engineering programs should edu-
cate professionals that are knowledgeable on the entire AI engineer-
ing life-cycle. These professionals should form multidisciplinary
teams to build production-ready machine learning systems. Our
future work lies in further investigating the different profiles of AI
engineers and their education, and in investigating development
processes and supporting tools for GenAI Engineering teams.
