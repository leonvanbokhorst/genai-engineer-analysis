## Introduction

The term "Artificial Intelligence" (AI) has captured the public imagination and driven scientific innovation for decades. However, its meaning has not remained static. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of how the definition of AI has evolved from its inception in the 1950s to the present day, with a particular focus on the transformative period of 2020-2025. We will examine the shifting terminology within the scientific community, the changing perceptions of the general public, and the dynamic interplay between these two domains. By tracing the historical trajectory of AI terminology, we can gain a deeper understanding of the field's progress, its societal impact, and the future challenges it presents.




## Chapter 1: The Historical Foundations of AI (1950s-2000s)

The story of AI begins not with silicon chips, but with a bold conjecture. In 1956, a group of visionary scientists gathered at Dartmouth College for a summer workshop that would not only christen a new field of inquiry but also set the stage for decades of research and debate. The term "Artificial Intelligence" was formally proposed by John McCarthy as a neutral umbrella to encompass the diverse research efforts aimed at simulating human intelligence in machines. The Dartmouth workshop's foundational premise was that "every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it." This ambitious vision laid the groundwork for the exploration of key areas that continue to define the field today, including natural language processing, neural networks, and problem-solving.

The early years of AI were dominated by the symbolic approach, often referred to as "Good Old-Fashioned AI" (GOFAI). This paradigm, rooted in the rationalist tradition of Western philosophy, posited that intelligence could be replicated through the manipulation of symbols according to formal rules. The Physical Symbol System Hypothesis, formulated by Allen Newell and Herbert Simon, became a central tenet of this approach, suggesting that a system capable of manipulating symbols had the necessary and sufficient means for general intelligent action. This led to the development of expert systems in the 1980s, which were among the first commercially successful forms of AI. These systems, such as MYCIN for medical diagnosis and DENDRAL for chemical analysis, captured the knowledge of human experts in specific domains and used it to solve complex problems. The terminology of this era reflected this focus on knowledge, with terms like "knowledge base," "inference engine," and "rule-based systems" becoming central to the AI lexicon.

However, the symbolic approach was not without its challengers. A competing paradigm, known as connectionism, emerged from early work on neural networks. This approach, inspired by the structure of the human brain, sought to create intelligence through the interconnected workings of simple processing units. The philosophical divide between symbolic and connectionist AI mirrored the long-standing debate between rationalist and empiricist views of the mind. While symbolic AI excelled at tasks requiring high-level reasoning, connectionism held the promise of learning from data and recognizing patterns, a capability that would become increasingly important in the decades to come.

The history of AI has not been a story of uninterrupted progress. The field has experienced several "AI winters," periods of reduced funding and public interest resulting from a failure to meet overly optimistic expectations. The first AI winter, in the mid-1970s, was triggered by the limitations of early machine translation and the critiques of perceptrons. The second AI winter, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, was marked by the collapse of the LISP machine market and the decline of expert systems. These periods of retrenchment had a profound impact on AI terminology, leading to a more cautious and specialized vocabulary within the research community.




## Chapter 2: The Early 21st Century Evolution (2000-2019)

The turn of the millennium marked a significant paradigm shift in the field of Artificial Intelligence. The limitations of the knowledge-based systems that had dominated the previous decades became increasingly apparent, and a new, data-driven approach began to take hold. This period witnessed the resurgence of machine learning, a subfield of AI that had long been overshadowed by the symbolic approach. The availability of vast amounts of data, coupled with increasing computational power, created the perfect conditions for a data-driven revolution.

The 2000s saw the rise of statistical machine learning techniques, with Support-Vector Machines (SVMs) and other kernel methods becoming popular for a wide range of tasks. The focus shifted from manually encoding knowledge to creating algorithms that could learn from data. This period also saw the release of important open-source machine learning libraries, such as Torch in 2002, which helped to democratize access to these powerful tools. The Netflix Prize, launched in 2006, further fueled interest in machine learning by demonstrating its potential for solving real-world business problems.

The 2010s witnessed an even more dramatic transformation with the advent of the deep learning revolution. The breakthrough moment came in 2012 with the success of AlexNet in the ImageNet competition. This deep convolutional neural network, developed by Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton, achieved a dramatic reduction in image recognition errors, far surpassing previous approaches. This success was a vindication for the connectionist approach and marked the beginning of a new era in AI. The term "deep learning," which had been coined by Hinton in 2007, entered the mainstream, and neural networks, which had been largely dismissed during the AI winters, experienced a dramatic resurgence.

The deep learning revolution led to a proliferation of new terminology. Terms like "convolutional neural networks" (CNNs), "recurrent neural networks" (RNNs), and "long short-term memory" (LSTM) became central to the AI lexicon. The development of word2vec in 2013 revolutionized natural language processing by introducing the concept of "word embeddings," which allowed words to be represented as vectors in a continuous space. This period also saw the establishment of a clear terminology hierarchy, with AI as the broad field, machine learning as a subfield, and deep learning as a subfield of machine learning.

While the scientific community was developing this new, more precise terminology, the public's understanding of AI was also evolving. The term "AI" began to be used more broadly in the media and in marketing, often as a catch-all for any form of automation. This led to a growing gap between the scientific and public understanding of AI. At the same time, the concept of "Artificial General Intelligence" (AGI) began to gain traction. The term was coined in 2007 to distinguish the goal of creating human-level intelligence from the more narrow, task-specific AI that was being developed at the time. The AGI terminology helped to frame discussions about the long-term goals and potential risks of AI, and it began to influence media coverage and public perception of the field.




## Chapter 3: The Contemporary Period: The Generative AI Revolution (2020-2025)

The period from 2020 to 2025 will be remembered as the era of the generative AI revolution, a time when the capabilities of artificial intelligence expanded at an unprecedented rate and the public's relationship with AI was fundamentally transformed. This period was marked by the emergence of powerful new technologies, a rapid evolution of AI terminology, and a growing awareness of the profound societal implications of advanced AI.

The catalyst for this revolution was the development of large language models (LLMs), a new class of transformer-based neural networks trained on vast amounts of text data. These models, such as OpenAI's GPT series, demonstrated a remarkable ability to generate human-like text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer questions in an informative way. The public release of ChatGPT in November 2022 was a watershed moment, bringing the power of generative AI to the masses and sparking a global conversation about the future of AI.

The generative AI revolution brought with it a host of new terminology. The term "generative AI" itself, which had been used in academic circles for years, entered the mainstream lexicon. Other new terms, such as "large language model" (LLM), "foundation model," and "multimodal AI," became central to discussions about the latest advancements in the field. The concept of "prompt engineering," the art of crafting effective instructions for AI models, emerged as a new skill. And technical terms like "emergent abilities," "hallucination," and "fine-tuning" became part of the broader conversation about the capabilities and limitations of these new technologies.

This period also saw a dramatic shift in the public's understanding of AI safety and alignment. The term "AI alignment," which had been a niche topic within the research community, became a subject of mainstream concern. The potential for AI to be used for malicious purposes, such as generating fake news or creating deepfakes, became a major topic of discussion. And the concept of "existential risk," the idea that advanced AI could pose a threat to human civilization, moved from the realm of science fiction to a serious topic of debate among scientists, policymakers, and the public.

The generative AI revolution has also been characterized by the intense competition between a handful of major technology companies. OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Anthropic have all invested heavily in the development of their own LLMs and generative AI products, leading to a rapid pace of innovation and a constant stream of new announcements. This corporate competition has played a significant role in shaping the public's understanding of AI, with each company promoting its own terminology and framing the technology in a way that aligns with its business goals.




## Chapter 4: Public vs. Scientific Community: A Tale of Two Terminologies

The evolution of AI terminology has not been a monolithic process. Rather, it has been a dynamic interplay between the precise, technical language of the scientific community and the more fluid, metaphorical language of the public. This chapter explores the key differences and convergences between these two terminological domains, and it examines the forces that have shaped their respective evolutions.

Throughout the history of AI, the scientific community has strived for terminological precision. Researchers have developed a specialized vocabulary to describe the various approaches, techniques, and concepts within the field. This has led to a clear hierarchy of terms, with AI as the broad umbrella, machine learning as a subfield, and deep learning as a subfield of machine learning. The scientific community has also been careful to distinguish between different types of AI, such as narrow AI, which is designed for specific tasks, and artificial general intelligence (AGI), which aims to replicate human-level intelligence.

In contrast, the public's understanding of AI has been shaped by a variety of factors, including science fiction, media coverage, and corporate marketing. In the early years of AI, the public's perception was heavily influenced by science fiction, with AI often being associated with sentient robots and dystopian futures. As AI has become more integrated into our daily lives, the public's understanding has become more nuanced, but it is still often characterized by a lack of technical precision. The term "AI" is often used as a catch-all for any form of automation, and there is often a conflation of narrow AI with AGI.

The media has played a crucial role in shaping the public's understanding of AI. A study of newspaper coverage of AI over the past four decades found that the media has often framed AI as a "sophisticated, powerful, and value-laden" technology. The study also found that the media has tended to focus on the potential applications and risks of AI, rather than on the technical details of the technology. This has led to a public discourse that is often more focused on the dramatic possibilities of AI than on the current state of the art.

In recent years, there has been a growing convergence between the scientific and public terminologies of AI. The release of ChatGPT and other generative AI tools has brought a new level of public awareness to the field, and terms like "LLM," "generative AI," and "AI alignment" have entered the mainstream lexicon. This has led to a more informed public discourse about AI, but it has also created new challenges. The rapid pace of innovation in the field has made it difficult for the public to keep up with the latest terminology, and there is still a significant gap between the technical understanding of the scientific community and the more general understanding of the public.




## Chapter 5: Conclusion: The Future of AI and Its Terminology

The journey of the term "Artificial Intelligence" from a niche academic concept to a globally recognized and debated topic is a testament to the transformative power of this technology. As we have seen, the meaning of AI has been in a constant state of flux, shaped by scientific breakthroughs, public perception, and the dynamic interplay between the two. The evolution of AI terminology is not merely a matter of semantics; it is a reflection of our evolving understanding of intelligence itself, and of our hopes and fears for the future of humanity.

The contemporary period, with its focus on generative AI and the growing concerns about AI safety and alignment, has brought a new level of complexity to the AI lexicon. The rapid pace of innovation has made it more important than ever to have a clear and precise terminology for discussing the capabilities and risks of these powerful new technologies. At the same time, the increasing public engagement with AI has created a need for a more accessible and understandable language for discussing these issues.

Looking to the future, it is likely that the evolution of AI terminology will continue to be a dynamic and contested process. As AI becomes even more integrated into our lives, we can expect to see a continued convergence between the scientific and public terminologies of AI. We can also expect to see the emergence of new terms and concepts as the technology continues to evolve. The challenge for the future will be to develop a shared language for discussing AI that is both technically precise and publicly accessible, a language that can help us to navigate the complex ethical and societal challenges that lie ahead.
