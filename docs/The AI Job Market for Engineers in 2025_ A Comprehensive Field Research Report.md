## The Impact of AI on Employment

The impact of AI on employment is a complex and multifaceted issue, with evidence suggesting both job displacement and creation, as well as significant shifts in the nature of work. The World Economic Forum's "Future of Jobs Report 2025" predicts that structural labor market transformation will amount to 22% of today's total jobs, with an expected creation of new jobs equivalent to 14% of today's total [1].

### Automation vs. Augmentation

A key finding from the Stanford study, "Canaries in the Coal Mine? Six Facts about the Recent Employment Effects of Artificial Intelligence," is that not all uses of AI are associated with declines in employment. The study distinguishes between automation and augmentation, finding that entry-level employment has declined in applications of AI that automate work, but not those that most augment it. This suggests that while AI can substitute for human labor in some tasks, it can also complement and enhance human capabilities in others [2].

> "We find employment declines for young workers in occupations where AI primarily automates work, while we find employment growth in occupations in which AI use is most augmentative. These findings are consistent with automative uses of AI substituting for labor while augmentative uses do not." [2]

### Disproportionate Impact on Entry-Level Workers

The Stanford study also reveals a significant and disproportionate impact on entry-level workers. Early-career workers (ages 22-25) in AI-exposed occupations experienced a 13% relative decline in employment, even after controlling for firm-level shocks. In contrast, employment for workers in less exposed fields and more experienced workers in the same occupations has remained stable or continued to grow [2]. This suggests that while the demand for experienced AI engineers remains high, the entry-level market is becoming increasingly competitive.

### Job Creation and Transformation

While AI is displacing some jobs, it is also creating new ones. The World Economic Forum report highlights that AI and big data are among the top drivers of job growth, with roles such as AI and Machine Learning Specialists, Data Analysts and Scientists, and Big Data Specialists expected to see significant growth [1]. The report also notes that many roles will be transformed, requiring new skills and capabilities. This transformation is not limited to technical roles; skills such as creative thinking, analytical thinking, and technological literacy are becoming increasingly important across all industries.

## Government and Policy Perspectives

Government agencies and policymakers are actively studying and responding to the impact of AI on employment. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has incorporated AI considerations into its employment projections, providing official government perspectives on how AI will affect the labor market.

### BLS Approach to AI in Employment Projections

The BLS Employment Projections program approaches AI in the same way as it does other technologies, with a focus on gradual, measurable change rather than rapid disruption. According to the BLS report "Incorporating AI impacts in BLS employment projections," the agency's projection methods are designed to measure and reflect structural technological changes, which tend to occur gradually over time [1].

> "BLS projection methods are not designed to capture extremely rapid technological change and, therefore, assume that the overall pace of technological change will be consistent with past experience." [1]

This conservative approach reflects the historical pattern that while new technologies often generate claims about widespread job displacement, such displacement tends to take longer than technologists typically expect. Many occupations affected by previous technological advances have still seen employment growth overall.

### Case Study Approach

The BLS has conducted detailed case studies examining the potential employment impacts of AI on selected occupations in computer, legal, business and financial, and architecture and engineering occupational groups. This methodical approach allows for nuanced analysis of how AI might affect different types of work within these fields [1].

### Policy Implications

The government's measured approach to AI employment impacts suggests that policy responses will likely focus on gradual adaptation rather than emergency interventions. This includes:

- **Workforce Development**: Supporting retraining and upskilling programs to help workers adapt to AI-augmented roles
- **Education Reform**: Updating educational curricula to include AI literacy and related technical skills
- **Research Investment**: Continued funding for research into AI's labor market impacts to inform future policy decisions
