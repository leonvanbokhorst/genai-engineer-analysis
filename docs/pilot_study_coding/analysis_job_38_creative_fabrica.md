# Manual Coding Analysis: Job Ad #38 (Creative Fabrica)

This document contains the manual coding for the "Machine Learning Engineer" position at Creative Fabrica.

- **Assigned Profile:** `AI-Adjacent Software Engineer`
- **Reasoning:** This is a fascinating and important case. Despite the "Machine Learning Engineer" title, the listed responsibilities are entirely focused on the integration and deployment of pre-existing models into applications. There are no tasks related to model creation, training, or fine-tuning. This role is a classic example of an "ML Integration Engineer," a software engineer who specializes in operationalizing models built by others.
