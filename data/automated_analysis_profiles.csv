992,Ambiguous / Not Relevant,4.0,"The job description heavily focuses on evaluating and providing feedback for AI models, rather than direct development or engineering of AI systems. While it mentions 'training' models, the tasks described are more about data annotation and quality assessment, which are often supporting roles rather than core AI engineering."
993,Ambiguous / Not Relevant,3.0,"The job description focuses on providing feedback to train AI models, primarily through crafting questions and evaluating code. While it involves generative AI, it lacks the core responsibilities of a GenAI Engineer, such as advanced prompt engineering, RAG systems, or fine-tuning. It appears to be more about data annotation or human-in-the-loop feedback rather than engineering AI models."
994,Ambiguous / Not Relevant,4.0,"The job description focuses on providing feedback and data for AI model training rather than actively building, developing, or deploying AI systems. While it mentions 'generative AI models', the tasks described are more aligned with data annotation and evaluation rather than engineering or development."
995,Ambiguous / Not Relevant,4.0,"While the job mentions ""generative AI models"" and ""AI large language models,"" the core tasks described focus on human feedback and evaluation to train models, rather than the direct development, fine-tuning, or engineering of these models by a software engineer. The emphasis is on providing data to train models, not building systems around them."
996,GenAI Engineer,4.0,"The role focuses on training and improving generative AI models, specifically large language models, by providing human feedback on code generation. This aligns strongly with the core responsibilities of a GenAI Engineer, particularly the modeling aspects using generative techniques."
997,ML Engineer,3.0,"The role heavily focuses on 'training AI models' and 'evaluating and ranking code generated by AI models,' which are core activities in model development and refinement. While generative AI is mentioned, the emphasis is on the training and evaluation process rather than building new generative systems or advanced prompting."
998,Ambiguous / Not Relevant,3.0,"While the job involves interacting with AI models, it focuses on human feedback for training rather than the development, fine-tuning, or deployment of AI systems by the candidate. The core tasks are more about data annotation and evaluation for AI model training, not engineering the models themselves."
999,Ambiguous / Not Relevant,4.0,"The job description primarily focuses on business understanding and high-level technical strategy without mentioning specific AI technologies, modeling tasks, or software development for AI applications. The emphasis is on interpreting business requirements and aligning solutions, which is too general for a specialized AI role."
