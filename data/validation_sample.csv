   Lunchen doe je in het bedrijfsrestaurant op de 18e verdieping, zo geniet je van je eigen of verse lunch en van het uitzicht over heel Rotterdam. Of je loopt even de stad in voor een wandeling. Na de lunch ga je aan de slag met het technisch uitwerken van pilots of opschalingen met Azure OpenAI. Of je maakt een PoC van een ander taalmodel waarmee je in korte tijd toetst of de oplossing financieel, technisch en functioneel haalbaar is voor Stedin.
   Als afsluiter heb je nog een meeting met een Architect en afdeling Security. Hier heb je het over de toepasbaarheid van de gemaakte oplossing en hoe die terecht moet komen in het Stedin IT landschap; wat zijn de kaders, is de gemaakte MVP veilig en kunnen we dit in de toekomst beter standaardiseren?

369,DevOps Engineer,AI-Adjacent Software Engineer,,4,,"The job description focuses heavily on DevOps and infrastructure management (Macro-Category A tasks like managing Azure, pipelines, containerization, security) with a mention of applying generative AI and developing a chatbot. While generative AI is mentioned, the core responsibilities and emphasis are on the operational and software engineering aspects of deploying and maintaining systems, rather than deep model development or prompt engineering. The role is described as more of an 'Operator' than a 'Developer', but with the capability to build integrations and software when needed. This aligns with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile, where AI/ML features are integrated into a product, and the primary focus is on the engineering and operational aspects.",,"DevOps Engineer

Samen werken aan toekomstbestendige zorg. Dát is waar jij je als DevOps Engineer bij Coöperatie VGZ. dagelijks voor inzet. Dit doe je binnen een gezonde werkomgeving, waar je gezien wordt en jouw talent ertoe doet. Nieuwsgierig naar de functie en naar Coöperatie VGZ als werkgever? Lees snel verder.
       Hoe jij het verschil maakt
       Als DevOps Engineer vertaal je innovatieve ideeën in werkende oplossingen en zorg je ervoor dat de infrastructuur en software betrouwbaar en efficiënt draaien. Je automatiseert en optimaliseert ontwikkelings- en uitrolprocessen. Van de ontwikkeling van een Chatbot tot en met de toepassing van generatieve AI, of van het gebruik van taaltechnologie tot en met het meewerken aan een hackathon om met partijen in de zorg aan open standaarden voor informatie-uitwisseling te werken.
       Je bent meer een Operator dan een Developer, maar als het noodzakelijk is, bouw je integratiescripts en eenvoudige software. Je weet alles van Microsoft backend- en frontend producten en als het nodig is, doe je een deepdive in een nieuw product om het je eigen te maken. Natuurlijk is security een continu concern en je bent op de hoogte van risico's en zorgt voor een veilige omgeving waarbij je soms certificaten en patches moet uitrollen. Daarnaast ben je innovatief, een probleemoplosser en creatief bij het bedenken van oplossingen.
       Samen met je collega's zorg je voor de stabiliteit van de developer- en infrastructuuromgevingen van de afdeling Innovation. Je werkt samen met collega's soms in verschillende experimenten, pilots of producten die we naar productie brengen. Binnen de afdeling is veel ruimte voor jouw passie voor DevOps en drive om resultaten te behalen. Jij maakt het team beter, het team maakt jou beter, samen verzilveren jullie technologische kansen voor een betere zorg in Nederland!

Als AI Engineer ben je bezig op het raakvlak van data, software engineering en AI-technologie. In die brede waaier van zaken doe jij de end-to-end ontwikkeling van software, platformen, tools en (tijdelijke) pipelines om data van A naar B te krijgen.

   Een AI Engineer bij iO gaat aan de slag met diverse problemen. Van het slim inzetten of fine-tunen van Large Language Models of het toepassen van RAG-patronen, tot het bouwen van een pipeline om data bijeen te harken, te transformeren en te voeden aan een data platform. Het terugkerende patroon is dat je bestaande cloud services en APIs integreert tot een efficiënt, schaalbaar en betrouwbaar geheel.

   Prompt engineering is voor jou een heerlijke 'art form', waarbij je creatief nadenkt over hoe je de beste resultaten kunt krijgen, met oog voor het voorkomen van hallucinaties of het toepassen van slimme guardrails. Je evalueert je oplossingen op een systematische manier om inzicht te krijgen in de kwaliteit van de output.

   Je komt in je werk als AI Engineer in aanraking met allerlei soorten AI: van statistische modellen tot Large Language Models, van Generative AI op het vlak van afbeeldingen, video en audio tot Natural Language Processing. Het gaat in jouw job vooral om het inzetten en toepassen van bestaande (open source) modellen en services, en het maken van de infrastructuur daaromheen. Ook kleine tweaks en/of pre- en postprocessing op data naar AI-modellen horen bij je werk. Je bent perfect op de hoogte van wat de markt te bieden heeft, en waar de sterke en zwakke punten liggen van diverse AI-oplossingen.

   Je werkt aan allerlei verschillende klantvraagstukken: van het automatisch analyseren van documenten tot het herkennen van gebeurtenissen in audio of videodata, en van het genereren van gave grafische output op basis van data tot het creëren of valideren van content. Daar waar AI een plek kan vinden, zet jij als engineer de totaaloplossing neer.

   Het 'from the ground up' opbouwen van AI-modellen hoort niet bij de AI Engineer, maar bij de Data Scientist. Wel heb je genoeg begrip van de structuur van AI-modellen om met een Data Scientist over de inhoud te kunnen sparren.

   Je werkt in een team met diverse AI-engineers en Data / BI-specialisten en werkt op basis van moderne (cloud)platformen, SaaS-services en talen als TypeScript en Python.
