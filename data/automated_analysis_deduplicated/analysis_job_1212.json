        "rationale": "The job ad focuses on 'Intelligent Automation' and mentions 'robots', 'UiPath', and 'automations' as core tasks. While it lists 'AI and Machine learning, GenAI and Natural language processing' as tools for fixing issues, the primary focus appears to be on developing and deploying automations and monitoring them, which are more aligned with software engineering and operations (Macro-Category A). The AI/ML components are used as tools within this broader automation context rather than being the central focus of model development or specialization. Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, as it integrates AI/ML features into a product (automations) but the core of the role is software development and operations."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines tasks and technologies. However, the specific mention of 'AI and Machine learning, GenAI and Natural language processing' is within the context of 'fixing issues in robots', which could be interpreted in multiple ways. It's not a deep dive into model development but rather an application of these technologies to solve problems within an automation framework. The profile assignment is strong, but the exact balance between A and B tasks could be slightly clearer if the AI/ML focus was more pronounced."
