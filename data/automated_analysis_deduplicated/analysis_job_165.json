        "rationale": "The job advertisement describes a Data Engineer role focused on developing data products within a Data Mesh architecture to enable software engineers. While it mentions data and enabling software engineers, it does not contain any tasks or technologies related to AI/ML model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, RAG, or the specific infrastructure for AI/ML operations (MLOps). The core responsibilities fall under traditional data engineering and enabling software development, not AI/ML specialization or integration."
