However, the mention of 'rule-based generative AI' is somewhat vague and could imply a deeper AI involvement than the rest of the description suggests. The core tasks are clearly software engineering, but the exact nature of the 'generative AI' component in the pipeline is not deeply detailed, leading to a slightly less than perfect confidence score."
