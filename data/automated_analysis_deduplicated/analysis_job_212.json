While it mentions leveraging 'generative AI' and an 'AI-first approach' for product features like 'TeachTap' and 'TeachTales', the focus is on building and integrating these AI-powered features into the product rather than developing or fine-tuning the AI models themselves. There are no explicit mentions of model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG implementation. Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, where the primary responsibility is software engineering with AI as a component of the product."

The distinction between building software that *uses* AI versus building the AI itself is well-defined by the tasks listed. The absence of specific AI model development tasks makes the classification straightforward."
