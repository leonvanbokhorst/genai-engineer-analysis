        "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on integrating AI capabilities into customer resolution processes and improving existing AI systems (Macro-Category A tasks like 'Software Development & Integration'). While there's mention of 'AI model fine-tuning sessions' (Macro-Category B), the primary emphasis is on applying human expertise to support and enhance AI-driven customer service, rather than developing core AI models or specializing in GenAI techniques like prompt engineering or RAG. The role is about using AI as a tool within a broader application context."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to AI integration and improvement within a customer support context. The distinction between core AI development and AI-adjacent application support is evident. However, the lack of specific technologies mentioned and the somewhat aggressive timeline for ramp-up prevent a perfect score."
