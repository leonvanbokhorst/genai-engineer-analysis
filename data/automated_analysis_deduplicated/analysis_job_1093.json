        "rationale": "The job description heavily emphasizes traditional software engineering tasks such as creating, improving, troubleshooting, maintaining, and updating platforms (1.A.1). While it involves integrating state-of-the-art AI technologies like LLMs and specific models (GPT-4 Vision, Amazon CodeWhisperer), the core focus remains on building and enhancing software systems that utilize these AI components. The role also includes providing support and guidance for internal teams and end-users, which are software engineering support functions. There is no indication of deep model development, fine-tuning, or specialized prompt engineering as the primary focus, nor is there a strong emphasis on traditional ML tasks. Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, where AI/ML features are integrated into a product."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines a blend of software development and AI integration. The tasks described align well with the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile. However, the mention of 'creating an assistant able to guide customers through an upgrade process' could hint at some prompt engineering, and the salary is a bit low for a senior role, which might suggest a slightly different emphasis than a purely adjacent role. Overall, the description is quite clear, but not perfectly unambiguous."
