While it mentions an interest in AI and exploring LLM integration, these are presented as future explorations or additions to an existing software product rather than the primary focus of the role. The core responsibilities are software development, with AI being an augmentation or future enhancement. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

The mention of AI and LLM integration is present but described as an exploration or future direction, not the primary focus. This makes the classification relatively straightforward, though the exact balance of future AI work is not fully detailed."
