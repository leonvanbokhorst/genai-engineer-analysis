While there is a 'focus on AI' and mention of 'AI applications,' the specific tasks do not involve deep AI model development or GenAI specialization. Instead, the role appears to be about building and managing the infrastructure and integration points for AI-powered applications, fitting the description of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is clear about the core responsibilities being DevOps and platform engineering. The 'focus on AI' is present, but the specific AI-related tasks are described in a way that points towards integration and operationalization rather than deep AI model work. The technologies listed also support this interpretation. It's not a perfect 5 because 'various AI applications' could be interpreted slightly differently, but the overall context strongly suggests an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer role."
