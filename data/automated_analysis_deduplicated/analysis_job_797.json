        "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on leading AI projects, implementing end-to-end ML pipelines, and advising clients on ML strategies. While it involves AI/ML, the core responsibilities lean towards the engineering and integration of these solutions within client contexts, rather than deep model development or specialization in GenAI. The emphasis on client interaction, pre-sales, and strategy also points to a role that leverages AI/ML as part of broader software solutions for clients. There is no mention of specific Generative AI tasks or technologies, nor deep traditional ML model building. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile, as it involves building and integrating AI/ML features into client-facing solutions."
    },
    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to leading AI projects, implementing ML pipelines, and client interaction. However, it lacks specific details on the types of ML models or GenAI techniques involved, and no specific technologies are mentioned. This leaves some room for interpretation regarding the depth of AI specialization versus software engineering integration. The profile assignment is strong based on the emphasis on implementation and client strategy, but the absence of technical specifics prevents a perfect score."
