        "rationale": "The job advertisement focuses heavily on core software engineering tasks related to Azure cloud infrastructure management, CI/CD pipelines, scripting, and ensuring system quality and compliance. While it mentions an interest in exploring GenAI, LLM, and Copilots, these are not presented as core responsibilities or required skills for model development, fine-tuning, or prompt engineering. The role is primarily about building and maintaining the underlying infrastructure and systems, making it an 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' or a 'Software Engineer' role that is open to learning about AI. Given the lack of specific AI/ML task definitions, it leans towards 'Software Engineer' as the primary classification, with the AI exploration being a secondary, forward-looking aspect."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines traditional software engineering and DevOps responsibilities. The mention of GenAI/LLM is exploratory rather than a core requirement for specific AI tasks. This makes the classification as 'Software Engineer' quite confident, but not a perfect 5 because the exploration of GenAI could imply a slight leaning towards AI-adjacent, though the core tasks are firmly in software engineering."
