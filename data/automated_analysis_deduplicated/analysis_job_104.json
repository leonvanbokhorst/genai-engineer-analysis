While it explicitly mentions extending support to \"generative AI and large scale models\" and developing \"solutions for NLP and generative AI\", these are framed within the context of building and enhancing the ML platform. The majority of coded tasks fall under Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering), with a significant portion of those tasks being directly related to building the platform that supports AI/ML. This aligns with the AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile, where the core is software engineering, but the product being built directly uses or supports AI/ML models as a core part of its functionality."
