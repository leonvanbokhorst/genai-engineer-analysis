        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on traditional ML tasks such as designing, developing, and implementing predictive models, algorithms (computer vision, regression, classification, optimization), and NLP. It also includes developing experiments and proof-of-concepts for model comparison and feasibility. While there is a mention of integrating AI solutions into business processes (1.A.1), the core responsibilities and emphasis are on the model development and experimentation side (1.B.1). There are no explicit mentions of Generative AI specific tasks like LLMs, RAG, or prompt engineering. The soft skills identified are communication and learning. Therefore, the profile 'ML Specialist (Data Scientist)' is the most appropriate fit."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to traditional ML tasks and soft skills. However, it lacks specific technology mentions, which would have provided further confirmation. The distinction between traditional ML and GenAI is clear from the task descriptions, but the absence of specific tools prevents a perfect score."
