While there are elements of creating AI tools and workflows (1.A.1), the core responsibilities (1.B.1) are centered around the AI models themselves, specifically generative AI. The role requires a deep understanding and manipulation of AI model architectures and their application in a novel computing environment, fitting the 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile due to the emphasis on generative AI model development and adaptation."

The focus on generative AI is explicit. However, the mention of 'AI toolkit' and 'AI development workflows' could slightly lean towards software integration, but the primary emphasis remains on the AI models themselves. The profile assignment is strong, but not a perfect 5 due to the nuanced interplay between model adaptation and tool creation."
