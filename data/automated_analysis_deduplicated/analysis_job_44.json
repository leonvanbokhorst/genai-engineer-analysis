        "rationale": "The job description heavily emphasizes traditional software engineering tasks related to troubleshooting, code-level analysis, integration, and support of a data analytics platform (Databricks). While ML/AI and Generative AI are mentioned, the core responsibilities revolve around the engineering and operational aspects of these technologies within a broader platform, rather than the development or specialization in AI/ML models themselves. The tasks are predominantly in Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration), with a mention of operations. There are no explicit tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG systems, which would place it in Macro-Category B. The mention of 'ML/AI/Delta/Streaming/Lakehouse' and 'Data Science' points to AI/ML as a component of the platform being supported, not the primary focus of model building."

    "confidence": {

        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the responsibilities being focused on technical solutions, troubleshooting, and customer guidance related to a specific platform (Databricks) and its components (Spark, Delta, Streaming). While 'AI' and 'ML' are mentioned, the context strongly suggests supporting and integrating these within a broader data analytics ecosystem rather than deep AI/ML model development. The profile assignment is straightforward based on this emphasis. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the term 'Data Science' is used, which could sometimes imply more model-centric work, but the overall context leans heavily towards engineering and integration."
