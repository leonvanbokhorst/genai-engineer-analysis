There are no tasks described that fall into Macro-Category B (AI Specialization). However, the tech stack explicitly mentions 'LLM providers,' indicating an awareness of or potential interaction with AI/ML technologies. This positions the role as 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' because it's a software engineering role operating within a context that includes AI/ML components, rather than a role focused on developing AI/ML models themselves."

The profile assignment is based on the presence of 'LLM providers' in the tech stack, which is the only indicator of AI/ML involvement, making the 'AI-Adjacent' classification a slight inference rather than a direct description of AI-specific tasks. This leads to a high, but not perfect, confidence score."
