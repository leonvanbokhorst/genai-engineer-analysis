While it involves LLM agents and data integration for knowledge bases, the core responsibility is building and maintaining the infrastructure and agents that deliver AI capabilities, rather than deep model development or research (Macro-Category B tasks). The statement 'We do not create models ourselves; we are a platform team' strongly supports this classification."

This provides strong evidence for classifying the role as AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."
