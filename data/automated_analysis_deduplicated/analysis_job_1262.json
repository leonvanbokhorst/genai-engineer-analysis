        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on traditional software engineering tasks (designing, developing, scaling platforms and services, code reviews, mentoring) which fall under Macro-Category A (1.A.1). While it mentions leveraging 'AI models and algorithms' to transform threat defense, it does not specify tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). The core of the role is building and integrating AI into a security platform, rather than specializing in the AI models themselves. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering responsibilities and mentions AI/ML as a component of the platform being built. However, it lacks specific details about the AI/ML tasks themselves (e.g., types of models, specific AI techniques beyond 'leverage AI models and algorithms'), which prevents a perfect score. The distinction between AI-Adjacent and Core AI Engineer is clear based on the emphasis on platform development."
