While it mentions experimenting with AI tools like Tensorflow and Huggingface Transformers, the core responsibilities are software development and integration (Macro-Category A), with a secondary focus on AI specialization (Macro-Category B). The role is about building and expanding an AI tool, making it an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the core responsibilities being full-stack development and the integration of an AI tool. The mention of specific technologies for both frontend and backend, along with the AI tools, provides good evidence. The only reason it's not a 5 is that the depth of AI involvement is described as 'experimenting' and 'working with', rather than deep model development or advanced GenAI tasks, which could be interpreted in slightly different ways, but the overall profile is clear."
