        "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on software development, integration, and operational aspects of an online platform. While the title 'NLP Engineer' indicates a specialization in Natural Language Processing (a subfield of AI/ML), the described tasks do not involve direct model development, fine-tuning, or specific GenAI/ML techniques. Instead, they focus on building and maintaining the software infrastructure that likely uses NLP capabilities. This aligns with the AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile, where the core is software engineering, augmented by an AI/ML domain focus."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering and operational tasks. However, the 'NLP Engineer' title implies an AI/ML context without detailing specific AI model development responsibilities, making the 'AI-Adjacent' classification a strong inference rather than an explicit confirmation of deep AI task involvement."
