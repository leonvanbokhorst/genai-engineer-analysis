While it involves 'using LLMs' and specific AI technologies like 'GPT-4 Vision' and 'Amazon CodeWhisperer', the core responsibilities are centered on building and maintaining software systems that incorporate these AI capabilities, rather than deep model development or specialization in AI algorithms. There are no tasks explicitly listed under Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization). This aligns with the definition of an 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' who builds or maintains software that directly uses or supports AI/ML models as a core part of its functionality."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is clear about the responsibilities, which are predominantly software engineering tasks involving AI technologies. The title 'AI Software Engineer' also supports this. However, it doesn't go into extreme detail about the specific AI techniques used within the LLM context, which would have made it a 5. The focus is more on the integration and platform building aspect."
