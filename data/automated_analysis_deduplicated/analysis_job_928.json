While it mentions 'generative AI' and '3D content automation' in the context of the company's product, the responsibilities listed for the QA Manual Engineer role do not involve developing, fine-tuning, or integrating AI models themselves. The tasks are about testing the software that *uses* these technologies, not about building or directly working with the AI components. Therefore, the role is classified as a 'Software Engineer' as it primarily involves traditional software quality assurance activities."

While the company's product involves AI, the role's tasks are explicitly focused on testing and defect management, which are standard software engineering support functions. There is no ambiguity regarding the core duties of this specific position."
