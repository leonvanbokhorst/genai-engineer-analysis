While it mentions working with AI and Generative AI, the core focus is on building and integrating these into broader data solutions and architectures, rather than deep model development or prompt engineering (Macro-Category B). The role is about shaping data-driven solutions and architectures, which aligns with building software that leverages AI, making 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' the most fitting profile."

However, it doesn't go into deep specifics about the AI tasks themselves, making it slightly less definitive than a role solely focused on model building or prompt engineering. The 'Senior Data Engineer' title also suggests a strong foundation in data infrastructure and engineering, which is primarily Macro-Category A."
