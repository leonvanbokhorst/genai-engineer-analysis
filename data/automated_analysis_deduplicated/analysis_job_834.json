        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on traditional software development and infrastructure management ('bouw van software en infrastructuur', 'plan, monitor en onderhoud je de werking ervan'). While it mentions an 'affinity with research' and 'current developments such as the use of artificial intelligence', there are no specific tasks or responsibilities related to building, fine-tuning, or integrating AI/ML models (Macro-Category B). The role is about building and maintaining software, with a general awareness of AI, rather than hands-on AI development. Therefore, it aligns best with the 'Software Engineer' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines core software development and operational tasks. The mention of AI is general ('inzet van artificiële intelligentie') and not tied to specific AI/ML development responsibilities, making the 'Software Engineer' profile a strong fit. However, the 'affinity with research' and 'multidisciplinary research team' could imply some exploration, but not enough to shift the profile without more concrete AI tasks. The confidence is high but not perfect due to the slight ambiguity around the depth of AI involvement."
