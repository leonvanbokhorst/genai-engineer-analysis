Specifically, tasks like streamlining ML development, supporting MLOps lifecycles, implementing CI/CD, orchestration, experiment tracking, deployment, and IaC are all core MLOps functions. While the role supports research teams and involves ML, it does not specify any tasks related to the development or fine-tuning of generative AI models (like LLMs, RAG, prompt engineering). The emphasis is on the operational and engineering aspects of making ML work efficiently and reliably. Therefore, it aligns best with a 'Core ML Engineer' profile, which involves a balanced mix of A and B tasks, but with a focus on traditional ML operations rather than GenAI specialization."

It explicitly mentions MLOps lifecycle, CI/CD, orchestration, experiment tracking, deployment, and IaC, which are all well-defined categories within the coding book. There is no ambiguity regarding the core focus of the role being on the operational and engineering aspects of ML, rather than on the development of AI models themselves or GenAI specific tasks."
