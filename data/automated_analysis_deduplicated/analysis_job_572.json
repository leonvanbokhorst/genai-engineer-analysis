        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on deploying and integrating ML models into production systems (1.A.1) and monitoring/optimizing them (1.A.2). While it mentions 'machine learning models', there is no specific mention of Generative AI tasks, models, or frameworks. The role also includes business understanding and communication (1.C.1, 3.1). The emphasis is on the engineering and operational aspects of ML within a broader software context, rather than core model development or specialization in GenAI, making 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' the most fitting profile."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to deploying, integrating, and monitoring ML models, as well as collaboration and business understanding. However, it lacks specific details about the types of ML models (e.g., traditional vs. generative) or the specific technologies/tools used, which prevents a perfect score. The profile assignment is strong based on the available information."
