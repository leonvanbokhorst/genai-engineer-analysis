While it mentions 'Big Data Analytics', there is no explicit mention of AI/ML models, generative AI, or specific AI/ML tasks like model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. The core responsibilities align with traditional software engineering and pre-sales technical roles, fitting the 'Software Engineer' profile as it does not involve building or integrating AI/ML into the product itself."

However, it doesn't explicitly mention AI/ML, which makes it difficult to definitively assign it to an AI-related profile. The confidence is high that it's a Software Engineer role, but low on the AI/ML aspect due to the absence of relevant keywords or tasks."
