While it mentions AI/ML toolkits and strategies, the core responsibility appears to be integrating and managing ML models within an application context, rather than deep model development or specialization in Generative AI. The role also includes client interaction for ML strategies (1.C.1) and guiding junior developers (3.1), indicating a strong software engineering foundation with AI/ML integration responsibilities."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly lists specific technical tools and responsibilities that align well with the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile. The emphasis on API building and client strategy, coupled with the mention of AI/ML toolkits, provides a good basis for classification. However, it lacks explicit detail on the *type* of ML models or the specific nature of the AI/ML strategies, which prevents a perfect score."
