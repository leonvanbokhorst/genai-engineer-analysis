While it mentions 'GenAI' and 'Machine Learning' as emerging technologies the team pilots, the core responsibilities and tasks described fall squarely within traditional software engineering and cloud operations (Macro-Category A). There are no specific tasks related to developing, fine-tuning, or prompt engineering of AI models (Macro-Category B). Therefore, the role is classified as a 'Software Engineer' with a focus on cloud infrastructure."
