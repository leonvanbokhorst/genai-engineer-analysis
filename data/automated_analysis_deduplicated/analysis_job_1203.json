It explicitly mentions core software engineering tasks like designing, developing, and maintaining AI systems, alongside MLOps, DevOps, and CI/CD. The inclusion of Generative AI as a specialization, combined with the software engineering and MLOps aspects, points towards a role that balances both traditional engineering practices and AI specialization, with a clear emphasis on modern AI techniques like LLMs."

The 'Fast Track' program description reinforces the focus on developing expertise in these areas. The only slight ambiguity is the breadth of specializations mentioned (Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Generative AI), but the overall framing points towards a role that integrates these, with a specific mention of Generative AI (LLM)."
