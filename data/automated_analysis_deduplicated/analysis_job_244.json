These tasks fall under Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering) and specifically within Operations & MLOps. There are no tasks described that involve the development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or integration of AI/ML models (Macro-Category B). The mention of GenAI, LLM, and Copilots is explicitly in the context of learning and exploring new technologies, not as a core job function. Therefore, the role aligns with the 'Software Engineer' profile, as it exclusively involves tasks from Macro-Category A and does not integrate AI/ML into the final product's core functionality."
