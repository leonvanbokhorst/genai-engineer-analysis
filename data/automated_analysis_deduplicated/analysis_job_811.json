        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on traditional software engineering tasks (designing, developing, scaling platforms and services, code reviews, mentoring) which fall under Macro-Category A. While it mentions leveraging AI models and algorithms, the core responsibilities are about building and integrating these into a security platform, rather than developing or specializing in the AI models themselves. There are no specific mentions of Generative AI tasks like prompt engineering or fine-tuning LLMs. Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, where AI is a component integrated into a broader software engineering effort."
