While it mentions working with LLM, AI technologies, and artificial intelligence, these are listed as one of several tasks and not the primary focus. The role is described as a 'Junior Software Engineer / Data Science' with a strong grounding in software development for machine and device construction and system integration. The AI/LLM aspect appears to be an addition to a core software engineering role, rather than the defining characteristic. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile, where the primary focus is software engineering with the integration of AI/ML features."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines a strong foundation in software engineering with specific mentions of embedded systems and machine/device construction. The inclusion of AI/LLM is present but not dominant. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, because the 'Data Science' part of the title and the AI/LLM mention could imply a slightly deeper involvement than just 'adjacent', but the detailed tasks lean heavily towards software engineering."
