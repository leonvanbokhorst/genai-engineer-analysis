The core responsibilities focus heavily on software development lifecycle management, codebase scaling, quality improvements, and overseeing application lifecycles (Macro-Category A). While 'generative AI' is mentioned as an area to 'explore', it is not a primary task or focus. The role is about building and maintaining software systems, with AI being a potential area of exploration rather than a core function. This aligns with the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile, where the primary focus is software engineering, and AI is integrated or explored as a feature."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly defines DevOps and software engineering responsibilities. The mention of 'generative AI' is exploratory and not a core requirement, making the AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile a strong fit. However, the ad is not extremely detailed on the 'exploring generative AI' aspect, which prevents a perfect score."
