These tasks fall predominantly under Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization), particularly 1.B.3. Data Engineering & Management and 1.B.1. Model Development & Fine-Tuning. There are no explicit tasks mentioned that fall under Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering). The role's focus is on the generative AI aspect and the data required for its training, aligning with the GenAI Specialist profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly specifies the domain (generative AI) and the core activities (training, data evaluation). However, it lacks detail on specific engineering practices, tools, or the depth of software engineering involvement, making it slightly less definitive than an ad with explicit technical requirements. The 'Big Data Engineer' title is broad, and the described tasks are more aligned with data preparation for AI training than traditional big data engineering pipelines."
