        "assigned_profile": "AI-Adjacent Software Engineer",
        "rationale": "The job advertisement heavily emphasizes core software engineering tasks, particularly backend development, API creation, and deployment on cloud platforms using Go. While it mentions an 'interest in GenAI' and having 'shipped multiple features and have many more in the pipeline,' the primary responsibilities and required experience are firmly rooted in traditional software engineering. There are no explicit tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG systems. Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, where AI is a component of the product but not the primary focus of the engineer's day-to-day development tasks."
    },
    "confidence": {
        "score": 5,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is very clear about the core responsibilities being backend software development and API creation. The mention of AI is framed as an 'interest' and future pipeline, not as a primary technical requirement for the role itself. The required skills (Go, PostgreSQL, cloud deployment) are all standard software engineering competencies. This clarity makes the classification straightforward."
