While it doesn't detail specific GenAI tasks like prompt engineering or RAG, the emphasis on owning the strategy and vision for Generative AI, combined with the requirement for 8+ years of ML engineering experience, Python proficiency, and experience with data engineering and cloud platforms, points towards a role that balances core ML engineering practices with a strong focus on Generative AI. The tasks are predominantly in Macro-Category A (strategy, architecture, stakeholder alignment, mentoring) but with a clear mandate for GenAI in Macro-Category B (owning GenAI capabilities). This balance, with a specific emphasis on GenAI, aligns best with the 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile."

It explicitly mentions Generative AI as a key domain. However, it lacks specific examples of hands-on GenAI tasks (like prompt engineering or fine-tuning specific models), making it slightly less definitive than a role that would detail those aspects. The role leans heavily into strategy and architecture (Macro-Category A), but the explicit mention of owning Generative AI capabilities places it firmly in the GenAI-focused category. The confidence is high due to the clarity of the strategic focus on GenAI, but not a perfect 5 due to the absence of granular GenAI task descriptions."
