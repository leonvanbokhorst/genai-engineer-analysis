        "rationale": "The job advertisement focuses heavily on traditional software development tasks such as crafting web applications, working with cloud architectures (AWS serverless), and implementing best practices through code reviews. While AI is mentioned as the domain of the products (TeachTap, TeachTales, TimeBack, Athena), the core responsibilities described for the engineer are purely software engineering. There are no specific tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, RAG, or AI data engineering. Therefore, the role is classified as a 'Software Engineer' who is building applications within an AI-focused company, rather than an engineer directly working on AI/ML models."
