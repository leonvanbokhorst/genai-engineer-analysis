While it lists 'Generative AI (LLM)' as a specialization, it also includes 'Deep Learning' and 'Computer Vision'. The emphasis on MLOps, DevOps, and general system development leans towards a balanced role. Given the explicit mention of Generative AI alongside other AI specializations and the strong software engineering foundation, 'Core GenAI Engineer' is the most fitting profile, assuming the program will provide the necessary GenAI focus."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines a training program leading to an AI Engineer role, detailing many relevant technical skills and areas of specialization. However, it is a description of a training program rather than a direct job posting, and the specific day-to-day tasks after the training are only broadly described. The mention of multiple AI specializations (Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Generative AI) makes it slightly less focused than a typical experienced hire role, but the overall intent is clear."
