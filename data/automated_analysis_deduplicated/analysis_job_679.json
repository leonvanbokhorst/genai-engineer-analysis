While it mentions 'AI-enhanced project delivery' and 'AI-driven professional services', it explicitly states 'Coding or programming' is NOT part of the role. The core tasks involve applying AI tools within a consulting framework and managing software configurations rather than developing AI models or core software infrastructure. This aligns with the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile, where the role integrates AI features into a product or service delivery, but the primary focus is not on building the AI models themselves or traditional software engineering from scratch."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the nature of the work, emphasizing the use of AI in consulting and explicitly stating that coding is not required. However, the term 'Implementation Engineer' and 'configuring surveys, panels, and data gathering processes' could be interpreted in slightly different ways, leading to a slightly less than perfect confidence score. The distinction between 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' and 'GenAI Specialist' is clear due to the lack of model development tasks."
