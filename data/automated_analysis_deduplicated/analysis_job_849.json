        "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on integrating specific functionalities into virtual assistants and developing these assistants, which are core software engineering tasks (1.A.1). While it mentions a platform (Microsoft Copilot Studio), it doesn't delve into the specifics of model development, fine-tuning, or advanced prompt engineering typical of a specialist role. The emphasis is on building and integrating AI-powered features into a broader system, rather than deep AI model work. The role also includes platform setup and management (1.A.2) and team guidance, aligning with an AI-focused software engineering role."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software development and integration tasks related to virtual assistants and mentions a specific platform. The tasks are well-defined within the context of building and managing these AI-powered applications. The profile assignment is straightforward based on the emphasis on integration and development rather than deep AI model specialization. A slightly lower score is given because the depth of AI model work is not explicitly detailed, but the overall direction is clear."
