While it mentions LLMs, the core tasks revolve around understanding and improving the performance of these models and the underlying infrastructure, rather than developing novel generative AI capabilities or applications. The tasks are primarily focused on the 'how' of making AI systems perform well, which aligns with traditional ML engineering principles applied to a modern domain (LLMs). There's a strong emphasis on software development (implementing analysis tools) and deep system understanding, but the AI specialization is more about performance tuning of existing models rather than generative tasks like prompt engineering or fine-tuning for specific generative outputs. Therefore, it leans towards a 'Core ML Engineer' profile that is specializing in the performance aspects of LLMs."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite detailed regarding the technical responsibilities and required skills. The focus on performance analysis, benchmarking, and optimization of AI workloads, particularly LLMs, is clear. The distinction between this role and a pure GenAI Specialist or AI-Adjacent Software Engineer is discernible due to the deep dive into performance metrics and system-level analysis. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the term 'LLM training' could imply some aspects of model development, but the overwhelming emphasis remains on performance engineering of these systems."
