While there's a strong emphasis on the 'engineering' aspect (Macro-Category A), the core focus is on Generative AI technologies (LLMs, Generative AI). The role also involves significant leadership and strategic input typical of a Staff Engineer (1.C.1), which is common in senior AI/ML roles. Given the explicit mention of Generative AI and LLMs as the core technology focus, and the blend of software engineering and AI specialization tasks, the 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile is the most fitting. It's not purely AI-adjacent software engineering because the AI/GenAI work is central to the role's output, and it's not a specialist role as it heavily involves integration and infrastructure building."
