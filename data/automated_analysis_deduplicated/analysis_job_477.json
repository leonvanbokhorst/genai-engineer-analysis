        "rationale": "The job description heavily emphasizes traditional software development tasks ('Full Stack Developer', 'backend', 'frontend', 'implementeren van AI-applicaties', 'inrichten van cloud-omgevingen') which fall under Macro-Category A. While it mentions 'Generative AI-toepassingen' and 'Data Science, Deep Learning', the core responsibilities described are about building and integrating these into applications and cloud environments, rather than deep model development or specialization. The role also includes business strategy alignment and team coaching. This profile aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, as the primary focus is on software engineering with AI as a component, rather than AI specialization."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines a full-stack development role with an AI focus. The tasks are well-defined within software engineering and integration, with a mention of Generative AI applications. The profile assignment is straightforward based on the emphasis on Macro-Category A tasks. The confidence is high, but not perfect (5), as the depth of AI involvement beyond 'implementing' and 'developing' applications is not extensively detailed, leaving a slight ambiguity about the balance between A and B tasks."
