It also includes significant operations and MLOps tasks (1.A.2) related to CI/CD, DevOps, and cloud infrastructure management. While it mentions GenAI, LLM, and Copilots, these are listed as areas to 'learn and explore' and are not the primary focus of the tasks. The role's core responsibility is developing and managing cloud-based solutions and infrastructure, integrating AI/ML features as part of that, rather than specializing in model development or GenAI tasks themselves. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

The mention of GenAI/LLM is present but secondary to the core infrastructure and development responsibilities. The tasks are well-defined, leading to a confident classification. A score of 4 reflects that while clear, the explicit depth of AI/ML integration into the *product* itself isn't as detailed as it could be, but the overall role is well-understood."
