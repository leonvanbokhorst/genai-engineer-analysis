        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on research and development of Large Language Models (LLMs), including developing them from scratch, conducting cutting-edge research on them, and advancing their responsible development. While it mentions a team of researchers, scientists, and developers, the core tasks described are centered around the AI specialization (Macro-Category B) and specifically within Generative AI. There is no mention of integrating these models into existing software applications or traditional software engineering tasks (Macro-Category A). Therefore, the profile is 'GenAI Specialist'."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly indicates a focus on LLM research and development, aligning well with the 'GenAI Specialist' profile. However, it is a brief description and lacks specific details on the day-to-day tasks or required technologies, which prevents a perfect score. The emphasis on 'research' and 'developing from scratch' strongly points towards specialization rather than a balanced engineering role."
