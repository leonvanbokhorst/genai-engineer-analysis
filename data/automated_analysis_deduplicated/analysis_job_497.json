None of these tasks align with the definitions provided in the CODING_BOOK.md for Core Software Engineering (Macro-Category A) or GenAI Specialization (Macro-Category B), which are specifically focused on AI/ML concepts, models, and infrastructure. The role does not involve any AI/ML development, integration, or specialization."
