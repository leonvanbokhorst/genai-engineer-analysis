These tasks fall entirely within Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization), with no mention of core software engineering responsibilities (Macro-Category A). Therefore, the profile is GenAI Specialist."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the core tasks related to AI model training and evaluation, strongly indicating a specialist role. However, the title 'Big Data Engineer' seems somewhat misaligned with the described tasks, and there's a lack of specific technical tools or methodologies mentioned, which slightly reduces the certainty compared to a highly detailed ad."
