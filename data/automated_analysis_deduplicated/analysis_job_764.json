The advertisement contains no mention of AI, Machine Learning, or Generative AI tasks or technologies, which are prerequisites for other AI-focused profiles. Therefore, it aligns with the definition of a `Software Engineer` as per the `CODING_BOOK.md`."

        "reasoning": "The job title is very specific and clearly indicates a software engineering role without any mention of AI/ML. This allows for a confident classification into the `Software Engineer` profile. However, the extreme brevity of the ad means there is no detail to explore potential AI/ML integrations or nuances, limiting the depth of the analysis."
