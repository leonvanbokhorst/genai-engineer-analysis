        "rationale": "The job advertisement focuses heavily on traditional software engineering tasks such as tackling complex greenfield projects, transforming environments, and working with microservices. While 'generative AI' is mentioned, it's in the context of receiving training alongside other software engineering skills. The core responsibilities and technologies listed (TypeScript, Go, microservices) are indicative of a software engineering role that integrates AI as a component, rather than specializing in AI model development or GenAI-specific tasks. The emphasis is on building and transforming software systems, with AI being a skill to be acquired and integrated, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."
    },
    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines a software engineering focus with mentions of specific programming languages and architectural styles. The inclusion of 'generative AI' is framed as a training area rather than a primary job duty, making the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile a strong fit. However, the ad is more focused on the team and company culture than detailing specific AI integration tasks, which prevents a perfect score."
