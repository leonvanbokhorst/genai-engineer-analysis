        "rationale": "The job advertisement heavily emphasizes traditional software engineering tasks such as developing and deploying back-end solutions, creating cloud-native applications, and conducting code reviews. While it mentions leveraging AI tools to improve efficiency and integrating AI-driven solutions, the core responsibilities and the majority of the described tasks fall under Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering). There is no indication of deep specialization in model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, where AI is a tool to enhance software engineering rather than the primary focus of specialized AI work."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering responsibilities and mentions the use of AI as a tool for enhancement. However, it lacks specific details about the types of AI models or the depth of AI involvement beyond 'leveraging AI tools' and 'AI-driven innovations', which prevents a perfect score. The focus remains strongly on software development."
