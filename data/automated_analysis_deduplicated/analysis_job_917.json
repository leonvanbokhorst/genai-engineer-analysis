It requires programming skills (Python), data analysis, MLOps, DevOps, and CI/CD. The role involves designing, developing, and maintaining AI systems, working with senior colleagues, and applying learned knowledge. While there's a strong emphasis on software engineering practices (MLOps, DevOps, CI/CD, system design/development), the explicit mention of Generative AI specialization and the goal of becoming an AI Engineer with these skills points towards a core AI role. Given the specialization options, 'Generative AI (LLM)' is listed, and the overall framing is about developing AI systems, the 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile is the most fitting, as it balances core software engineering tasks with specific GenAI specialization."
    },
    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the skills to be acquired and the specialization areas. However, it's framed as a training program ('Fast Track') leading to an AI Engineer role, rather than a direct hire for an experienced AI Engineer. The specific tasks are listed as learning objectives, and the actual project work is described as applying 'opgedane kennis' (acquired knowledge). This makes it slightly less direct than an ad for an experienced role, hence a score of 4 instead of 5."
