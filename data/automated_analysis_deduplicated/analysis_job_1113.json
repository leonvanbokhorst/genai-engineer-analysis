While there's mention of AI model fine-tuning and testing new AI tools, the core responsibility is the application and improvement of AI within a support context, rather than deep model development or specialization. The role is about using AI to enhance an existing function (customer support) and improving the AI as part of that process, making it 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer'."

The distinction between core AI development and applying AI to solve business problems is evident. However, the ad is concise, and some nuances of the 'fine-tuning' aspect could be interpreted differently, leading to a slightly less than perfect confidence score."
