While it mentions building new AI solutions and working with LLMs, the core focus is on the engineering and operational aspects of bringing these solutions to life in a production environment. The role is primarily about integrating and operationalizing AI rather than deep model development or specialized GenAI tasks. There are no specific GenAI technologies or traditional ML tasks detailed, but the emphasis on deployment and production readiness aligns with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the primary responsibilities related to deploying and scaling AI solutions, which strongly points towards an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer role. However, the lack of specific technologies mentioned (like particular LLMs, frameworks, or traditional ML models) and the brief mention of 'building new AI solutions' leaves a slight ambiguity. It's not a pure Software Engineer role as AI integration is central, nor is it a Core GenAI/ML Engineer as the deep development/tuning is not the primary focus. The confidence is high but not perfect due to this lack of specific technical detail."
