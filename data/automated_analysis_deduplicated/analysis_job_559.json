Specifically, it mentions 'generative AI solutions' alongside other ML tasks like anomaly detection and classification. The emphasis on collaborating with software engineers, product thinking, and developing solutions that integrate into a product points towards a 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile, as it requires both strong software engineering practices and AI/ML model development, with a specific mention of generative AI."
