While LLM is mentioned, the core responsibilities are about building and maintaining the infrastructure and pipelines for these applications, rather than developing or fine-tuning the LLMs themselves. This aligns with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile, where the role supports AI/ML features through robust engineering practices."

The mention of 'LLM applications' and 'AI platform infrastructure' clearly places it within the AI domain, but the tasks themselves are predominantly infrastructure and operations-focused. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the role is described as 'Senior DevOps Engineer' and the AI aspect is a component of the infrastructure they manage, rather than the primary focus of building AI models."
