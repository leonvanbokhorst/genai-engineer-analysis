While it mentions 'leveraging machine learning and statistical analysis' for anomaly detection, the core responsibilities are about building and managing the infrastructure and systems that handle telemetry data, rather than developing or fine-tuning ML models themselves. There is no mention of Generative AI specific tasks or tools. Therefore, the role is classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, as it involves building software that utilizes AI/ML components."

The mention of ML/statistical analysis for anomaly detection is present but not the primary focus. The absence of any Generative AI specific tasks makes the classification towards AI-Adjacent Software Engineer relatively straightforward. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the ML aspect could be interpreted with slightly more depth depending on the actual implementation of the 'anomaly detection systems'."
