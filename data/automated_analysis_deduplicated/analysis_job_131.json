        "rationale": "The job ad heavily emphasizes research into deep learning and NLP techniques, improving dialog systems, and introducing new model architectures and optimizations. These are core tasks related to model development and specialization (Macro-Category B). While there's a mention of creating products used by millions (implying integration), the primary focus and detailed descriptions are on the model-centric aspects rather than broader software engineering or MLOps. There is no mention of Generative AI specific tasks like prompt engineering or RAG. Therefore, the role is best classified as an ML Specialist (Data Scientist) focused on traditional ML/NLP model development."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines tasks related to model research, development, and improvement in NLP and deep learning. The distinction between traditional ML/NLP and GenAI is clear from the absence of GenAI-specific terms. The collaboration aspect is also evident. However, the ad is relatively brief and doesn't detail specific tools or MLOps/deployment aspects, which prevents a perfect score."
