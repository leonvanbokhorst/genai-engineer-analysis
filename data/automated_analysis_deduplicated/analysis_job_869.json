While it mentions applying 'AI tools and techniques to automate repetitive tasks,' the core responsibility remains the configuration and delivery of CPQ solutions. The AI aspect appears to be a tool for enhancing existing software engineering tasks rather than the primary focus of model development or specialization. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software configuration and customer interaction as primary tasks. The mention of AI is present but framed as a tool to improve existing processes rather than the core focus of the role. The profile assignment is relatively straightforward based on this emphasis. A slightly lower score is given because the 'AI tools and techniques' is somewhat vague and could imply a deeper AI involvement than explicitly stated, but the overall context points strongly to an adjacent role."
