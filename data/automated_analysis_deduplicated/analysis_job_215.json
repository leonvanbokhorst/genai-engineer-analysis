The mention of 'AI-First' and 'utilize AI tools and methodologies' indicates that AI is a significant component, but it's framed as a tool to enhance efficiency in the core software engineering tasks (configuration, automation). The role does not involve developing AI models or specializing in GenAI techniques like prompt engineering or RAG. Therefore, the profile is AI-Adjacent Software Engineer as it's primarily a software engineering role that integrates AI capabilities to improve its processes."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly defines the core responsibilities as Salesforce CPQ configuration and client interaction. The AI aspect is present but described as a tool for efficiency rather than a core development area. The profile assignment is straightforward based on this emphasis. The only slight ambiguity is the extent of 'AI-First' which isn't fully detailed in terms of specific AI tasks beyond using tools."
