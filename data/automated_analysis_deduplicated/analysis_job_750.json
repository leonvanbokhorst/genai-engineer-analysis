        "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on 'designing, building, and implementing cloud and AI solutions' which falls under Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration). While AI is mentioned, there are no specific tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). The role appears to be about building and managing the infrastructure and applications that *use* AI, rather than developing the AI models themselves. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the core responsibilities being the design, build, and implementation of cloud and AI solutions. However, it lacks specific details about the AI technologies or models involved, and the mention of 'AI solutions' is broad. The focus is on the engineering aspect of deploying these solutions rather than the AI specialization itself. This makes the profile assignment reasonably confident but not absolutely certain without more specific AI-related task descriptions."
