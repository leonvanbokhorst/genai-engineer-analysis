While it mentions 'Generative AI' as a vision for empowering users, the core responsibilities described are about building and maintaining the data infrastructure and models that would support such a vision, rather than directly developing or fine-tuning GenAI models themselves. The tasks are predominantly in software development and operations, with AI being an integrated feature or goal rather than the primary focus of the role's day-to-day activities. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering and data platform responsibilities. The mention of 'Generative AI' is in the context of a vision for empowering users, rather than specific GenAI development tasks. This makes the classification as 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' quite clear, but a slightly higher score would be warranted if there were more explicit details on the AI integration itself."
