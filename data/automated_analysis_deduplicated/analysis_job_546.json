        "rationale": "The job advertisement is extremely brief and contains only the title 'ai engineer' and location 'netherlands'. It lacks any description of job tasks, responsibilities, required technologies, or specific AI/ML focus areas. Consequently, it is impossible to determine if the role involves Core Software Engineering tasks (Macro-Category A) or GenAI Specialization tasks (Macro-Category B). As per the coding book's definitions, the 'Not Relevant' profile is assigned when no significant tasks from either macro-category can be identified, which is the case here due to the complete absence of descriptive content."

        "reasoning": "The job advertisement is exceptionally minimal, providing only a job title and location. It contains no details regarding responsibilities, required skills, technologies, or the specific nature of the AI work. This lack of information renders any analysis highly speculative, leading to a very low confidence score."
