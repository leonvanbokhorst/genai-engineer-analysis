While it mentions leveraging AI and LLMs, the core responsibilities revolve around software development, data pipeline professionalization, and turning research into robust analytics. The role is about building and maintaining a software system that *uses* AI/LLM capabilities, rather than focusing on the core development or specialization of the AI models themselves. The tasks are predominantly in Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration, Operations & MLOps) with a clear application of AI/LLM technologies within that framework."

The mention of 'quantitative portfolio manager' and 'quantitative models' suggests a strong analytical and financial domain focus, which is well-integrated with the AI aspects."
