While it mentions experimenting with AI tools like GPT-4 Vision and integrating them, the core focus remains on building and deploying these AI capabilities within a broader software engineering context, rather than deep model development or specialization in generative AI tasks like prompt engineering or RAG. The role appears to be about integrating AI features into software products, making 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' the most fitting profile."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering responsibilities with an AI component. The tasks are well-defined, and the technologies mentioned are specific. The primary reason for not giving a 5 is the slight ambiguity in whether the 'experimenting' and 'integrating' of AI tools implies a deeper dive into AI model specifics or a more surface-level integration, but the overall emphasis on building and deploying scalable systems strongly points towards an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer role."
