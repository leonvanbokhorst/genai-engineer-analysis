While it mentions interacting with an 'AI-powered platform' and working on projects involving a 'Generative AI tool' and an 'AI Chatbot,' these are framed as features or systems to be developed or integrated with, rather than core AI model development or specialization. Therefore, the role is classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is very clear about the core responsibilities being software engineering (Go development) and the interaction with AI being at the system integration level, not model building. The distinction between a software engineer working with AI and an AI specialist is well-defined by the ad's content."
