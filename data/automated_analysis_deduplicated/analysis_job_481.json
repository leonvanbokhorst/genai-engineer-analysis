These tasks fall under 'Software Development & Integration' (1.A.1) as per the CODING_BOOK. There are no mentions of Generative AI, traditional Machine Learning, or AI model integration, which are the core focus of Macro-Category B and other specific AI/ML profiles. Therefore, the role aligns with the 'Software Engineer' profile, as its tasks are exclusively from Macro-Category A and do not involve building or integrating AI models."

While the classification of tasks and technologies is straightforward based on the text, the lack of further context means there's a slight possibility of unmentioned AI/ML aspects. However, based solely on the provided text, the analysis and profile assignment are clear."
