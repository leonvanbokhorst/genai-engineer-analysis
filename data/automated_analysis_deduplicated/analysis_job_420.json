There is no mention of AI/ML model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, RAG, or any specific AI/ML technologies. The mention of 'AI-Augmented' in the title appears to be a descriptor of the company or the tools they might use for productivity, rather than a core responsibility of the role itself. Therefore, the role aligns with a 'Software Engineer' profile."
