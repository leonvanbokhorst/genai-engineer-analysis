While it mentions 'generative AI' as an area to explore, it is not presented as a core responsibility or a primary focus of the role. The technologies listed are primarily programming languages and application frameworks. The soft skills emphasize communication, collaboration, and continuous learning, all common in software engineering roles. The career progression paths (lead engineer, software architect) are also typical for software engineers. Therefore, the role is classified as a 'Software Engineer' as it does not involve significant AI/ML model development or integration into the product's core functionality."

The distinction between traditional software engineering and AI specialization is well-defined, and the ad clearly places itself in the former category, with AI being an area for exploration rather than a core task. This clarity leads to high confidence in the analysis."
