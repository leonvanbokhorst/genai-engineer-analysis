        "rationale": "The job description focuses on integrating AI capabilities into customer support systems and improving existing AI models through feedback and fine-tuning. While there's an element of AI model improvement (1.B.1), the primary emphasis is on applying and integrating these AI capabilities into a broader support function and improving the system where AI falls short (1.A.1). The role is not about developing novel AI models from scratch or deep research, but rather about making AI work better within an existing operational framework. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to AI integration and improvement within a support context. The tasks are specific enough to categorize, although the 'AI model fine-tuning' aspect could lean slightly towards a specialist role, the overall framing points to integration. The salary and title suggest a more operational/support role rather than a pure AI/ML engineering role."
