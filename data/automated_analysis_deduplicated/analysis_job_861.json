It also requires integrating features into these assistants (1.A.1) and guiding the team on platform usage (1.C.1). The mention of 'Copilot Studio' points to a GenAI framework. While there's a strong software integration component, the core task of developing virtual assistants and the specific platform used firmly place this in the GenAI domain, with a balance between development/integration and specialized AI tasks. Therefore, 'Core GenAI Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is relatively clear about the core tasks and the technology (Copilot Studio). However, it lacks specific details on the depth of model development or the specific AI techniques beyond using the platform. The integration aspect is clear, but the AI specialization could be more detailed."
