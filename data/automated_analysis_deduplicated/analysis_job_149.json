        "rationale": "The job description emphasizes traditional software engineering tasks such as developing and maintaining services, implementing solutions, participating in DevOps user stories, and managing projects. While it involves 'M365 Copilot,' the tasks described (strategy, implementation, advising on use, technical readiness) focus on integrating and scaling this AI feature within the existing Microsoft 365 platform, rather than core AI model development, fine-tuning, or advanced prompt engineering. This aligns with the definition of an 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' who builds or maintains software that directly uses or supports AI/ML models as a core part of its functionality."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the responsibilities and the technologies involved (Microsoft 365 ecosystem, Copilot). The tasks are well-defined within the context of platform engineering and integration. The only slight ambiguity is the depth of 'AI' involvement, but the description leans heavily towards integration and platform extension rather than core AI research or development. This makes the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile a strong fit."
