        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on tasks related to training and evaluating generative AI models (Macro-Category B), specifically mentioning 'train AI models', 'helping generative AI models write better code', and 'Evaluating and ranking code generated by AI models'. While it mentions 'experienced software engineer', the core responsibilities are centered around the AI model itself rather than integrating AI into a broader software product (Macro-Category A). There are no explicit software development or MLOps tasks mentioned. Therefore, the profile is 'GenAI Specialist'."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the core tasks related to AI model training and evaluation. However, it is brief and lacks detail on specific technologies or the broader software engineering context, which prevents a perfect score. The distinction between AI-Adjacent Software Engineer and GenAI Specialist is clear based on the provided tasks."
