However, there are no specific tasks related to developing, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG for Generative AI or traditional ML models (Macro-Category B). The emphasis is on building and maintaining the software infrastructure that *uses* these AI technologies, fitting the definition of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

However, the specific nature of the 'advanced neural networks' (whether they are GenAI or traditional ML) is not detailed, and the primary language being C++ is less common for pure GenAI roles. This prevents a perfect score, but the role's positioning as a backend engineer integrating AI is unambiguous."
