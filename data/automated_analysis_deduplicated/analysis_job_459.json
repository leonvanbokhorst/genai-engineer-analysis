        "rationale": "The job ad focuses exclusively on traditional software engineering tasks such as designing, implementing, and maintaining backend services, monitoring production systems, and defining interfaces. While it mentions collaboration with 'Research teams' and bringing 'new functionality of their models' to users, there are no specific tasks or technologies related to AI/ML model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, RAG, or GenAI specialization. The role is clearly about building and operating software that may *use* models, but not about developing or specializing in AI/ML itself. Therefore, it fits the 'Software Engineer' profile."
