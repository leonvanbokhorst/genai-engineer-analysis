The emphasis on building customer-facing products and integrating AI solutions into them, along with the explicit mention of 'generative AI solutions' and the need to expand skills beyond AI into general software engineering, points towards a Core GenAI Engineer profile. The role is not purely specialized in GenAI (1.B.2) as it includes traditional ML tasks and significant software engineering components, nor is it purely AI-adjacent software engineering (1.A.1) as it involves direct model development and application of GenAI. It's a blend, with a clear focus on GenAI within that blend."
