        "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on implementing, configuring, and maintaining AI-driven systems to enhance operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. The tasks described, such as 'AI System Building', 'Service Configuration and Maintenance', and 'managing incidents', fall primarily under Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering). While AI tools are mentioned, the core responsibilities are about integrating and operating these systems within existing infrastructure (network functions like AAA, PCRF, SMSC, MMSC) rather than developing novel AI models or focusing on GenAI-specific tasks like prompt engineering or fine-tuning. There is no mention of traditional ML tasks or specific GenAI technologies. Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, as it involves building and maintaining software that utilizes AI but is not centered on AI model development itself."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the responsibilities and the context of using AI tools for operational improvements. It explicitly states what the role is and is not, which helps in classification. However, it lacks specific technical tool mentions and doesn't delve deeply into the 'AI' aspect beyond its application in system optimization, making it slightly less precise than a role focused purely on AI development."
