        "rationale": "The job ad focuses on exploring and implementing generative AI capabilities (like ChatGPT) to automate business processes. While it mentions business process automation (1.C.1), the core technical task is centered around generative AI (1.B.2). There are no explicit mentions of core software engineering tasks (Macro-Category A). Therefore, the role is best classified as a GenAI Specialist."
    },
    "confidence": {
        "score": 3,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is very brief and lacks detail regarding specific tasks, required software engineering skills, or the depth of involvement with generative AI. While 'ChatGPT' and 'generative AI' clearly point to GenAI, the absence of other details makes it difficult to definitively assign a more specific profile like 'Core GenAI Engineer' or to assess the balance between software engineering and AI specialization. The classification as 'GenAI Specialist' is based on the explicit mention of generative AI as the primary focus, with no indication of broader software engineering responsibilities."
