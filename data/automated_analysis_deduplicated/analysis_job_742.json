While Generative AI is mentioned as an area of expertise, the primary emphasis is on applying ML to business problems and delivering these solutions end-to-end, aligning with the 'Core ML Engineer' profile. There's a blend of software integration (delivering solutions end-to-end) and model development (ML Optimization, Computer Vision)."

It mentions 'Generative AI' as an area of expertise but the core description leans towards broader ML applications. This ambiguity makes it difficult to assign a profile with very high confidence."
