While it mentions developing 'end-to-end solutions' and 'operationalizing' them for production (1.A.1, 1.A.2), the core emphasis is on the ML model development itself (1.B.1). There is no mention of Generative AI specific tasks like LLMs, RAG, or prompt engineering. The collaboration aspect (3.1) is present but doesn't shift the core technical focus. Therefore, it aligns best with a 'Core ML Engineer' profile."

It is specific enough to identify the core focus on ML model development and operationalization. However, it lacks explicit mention of specific tools or technologies, and the distinction between traditional ML and GenAI is inferred from the task descriptions rather than explicit statements about the type of AI."
