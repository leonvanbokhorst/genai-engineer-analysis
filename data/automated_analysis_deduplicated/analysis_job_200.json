There are no specific tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). The mention of 'AI-driven features' positions it as AI-adjacent rather than a core AI/ML role."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is very brief, providing only one sentence for the core responsibilities. While the mention of 'AI-driven features' and 'C#' is clear, the lack of detail about the specific AI tasks or technologies limits the depth of analysis. The profile assignment is straightforward based on the available information, but more detail would increase confidence."
