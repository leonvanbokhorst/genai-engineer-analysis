The core tasks identified (1.A.1, 1.A.2) lean towards the software engineering and operational aspects of AI solutions rather than deep model development (1.B.x). The emphasis on DevOps and integration into existing systems, coupled with the mention of a broader engineering guild, points to a role that supports and integrates AI capabilities within a larger software engineering context, rather than a pure AI specialist or a traditional software engineer."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite brief. While the title strongly suggests a DevOps role for GenAI, the specific tasks are not detailed. The classification relies heavily on inferring tasks from the title and the general description of team collaboration and innovation. More explicit descriptions of responsibilities would increase confidence."
