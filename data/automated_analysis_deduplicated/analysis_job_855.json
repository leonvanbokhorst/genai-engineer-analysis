While 'generative AI' is mentioned as a training area and a technology to be integrated, the primary focus and responsibilities described are rooted in traditional software development and integration. The role is about building software that *uses* AI, rather than specializing in the AI model development itself. Therefore, it aligns best with the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines a software engineering role with an emphasis on traditional development practices and team collaboration. The mention of 'generative AI' is presented as a training area and a technology to be integrated, rather than the core focus of the role's day-to-day tasks. The description is detailed enough to distinguish it from a pure AI specialist role, but it could be more explicit about the *specific* integration tasks involving generative AI to achieve a perfect score."
