        "rationale": "The job description focuses on applying human expertise to improve AI systems and integrating AI capabilities into customer support. While there's mention of AI model fine-tuning and improving AI systems, the primary output seems to be enhancing the customer support function rather than developing core AI models. The tasks lean more towards integrating and refining AI within an existing system (customer support) rather than deep model development or specialized GenAI tasks. The emphasis on 'improving the AI system' and 'integrating AI capabilities' suggests a role that uses AI as a component within a broader software/service delivery framework, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines tasks related to AI improvement and integration within a customer support context. While it mentions 'AI model fine-tuning', the overall framing suggests a role that leverages AI rather than solely developing it. The distinction between improving an AI system and building a new one is subtle but present. The confidence is high due to the explicit mention of AI improvement and integration, but not a perfect 5 due to the slight ambiguity in whether the 'fine-tuning' is deep model work or more of a feedback loop for an existing system."
