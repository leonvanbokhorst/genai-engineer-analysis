While it mentions working with LLMs like GPT-4 and Claude (Macro-Category B tasks), the primary focus is on integrating these AI capabilities into broader web applications rather than deep model development or specialization. The role is described as 'not a position for those who prefer to specialize in a single aspect of development' and requires integrating AI 'across both front-end and back-end systems', indicating that AI is a feature within a larger software product. This aligns best with the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile, where the core is software engineering, augmented by AI integration."
