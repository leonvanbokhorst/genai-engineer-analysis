While it mentions 'Utilize and apply generative AI for products' and lists GenAI-specific technologies like LLMs, RAG, and vector databases, these are presented as features to be integrated or data sources for AI/ML, rather than the primary focus of model development or specialization. The role is about building software that *uses* AI, not necessarily developing the AI models themselves. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

The primary role appears to be software engineering with an AI component, making the profile assignment relatively straightforward. A slightly lower score is given because 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is a good fit, but there's a minor ambiguity if the 'data pipelines for AI/ML' could lean more towards specialization, though the overall emphasis remains on software development."
