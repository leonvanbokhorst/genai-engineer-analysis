While there's mention of 'AI model fine-tuning', the core responsibility is supporting customer resolutions by bridging gaps where AI falls short and improving the AI system itself, rather than developing novel AI models from scratch or specializing deeply in GenAI techniques. The role is about applying AI to enhance an existing support function, making it AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to AI integration and improvement within a support context. The tasks lean towards applying and refining existing AI rather than deep research or development of new AI models. The profile assignment is straightforward based on this focus. The confidence is high, but not perfect, as the term 'fine-tuning' could imply deeper ML work, but the overall context points to an adjacent role."
