While there is a mention of researching and implementing AI tooling like LLMs (1.B.1), this is presented as an innovation task within the broader operational context, rather than the primary focus of the role. The core responsibilities are centered around maintaining and improving the IT infrastructure, with AI being an integrated component rather than the sole focus. Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, as it builds and maintains software/infrastructure that supports AI features, but the primary emphasis is on the engineering and operational aspects."

The distinction between core infrastructure management and AI integration is discernible, allowing for a confident profile assignment. However, the depth of AI involvement is not as detailed as in a dedicated AI Engineer role, preventing a perfect score."
