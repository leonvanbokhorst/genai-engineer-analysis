While it mentions GenAI technology as the domain, the tasks themselves are primarily focused on the engineering and delivery aspects of software, rather than deep model development or specialization in GenAI techniques like prompt engineering or RAG (Macro-Category B). The role is about building and delivering software that *uses* GenAI, making it an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

While GenAI is mentioned as the domain, the core responsibilities are rooted in software engineering practices. The confidence is high, but not perfect, as the depth of involvement with GenAI specifics (beyond integration) is not explicitly detailed, leaving a slight ambiguity about whether it leans more towards a specialist role if the 'integration' implies significant model-level work."
