        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on traditional software engineering tasks such as system configuration, maintenance, incident management, and the implementation of AI-driven systems. While AI is mentioned as a tool and a driver for efficiency, the core responsibilities do not involve developing or fine-tuning AI models themselves (Macro-Category B). Instead, the role is about integrating and managing AI-powered systems to enhance existing operational processes, fitting the definition of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the responsibilities, emphasizing system configuration, maintenance, and the use of AI tools for operational improvement. It explicitly states it's not a traditional engineering or support role but combines technical work with AI. The absence of any mention of model development, fine-tuning, or specific AI/ML frameworks makes the classification as 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' quite clear. A perfect score is not given due to the slight ambiguity in 'AI System Building' which could lean towards model development, but the context strongly suggests integration and management."
