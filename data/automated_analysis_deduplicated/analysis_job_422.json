While it includes architectural and deployment aspects (Macro-Category A), the core focus is on the application and integration of advanced GenAI models (Macro-Category B, specifically 1.B.1 and the mention of specific GenAI tools). This balance, with a clear emphasis on Generative AI, points to a Core GenAI Engineer profile."

The mention of 'AI-First' and specific GenAI models strongly supports the classification. However, it lacks explicit detail on the 'fine-tuning' aspect of models or specific MLOps practices, which would elevate confidence to 5."
