While it mentions AI-powered education and integrating AI features, it does not detail specific AI model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG tasks. The focus is on building and evolving the software platform that *uses* AI, rather than the AI models themselves. This aligns with the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile, which is predominantly Macro-Category A with AI integration."

It explicitly states what the role is *not* about (e.g., 'chasing fleeting tech trends', 'getting bogged down in endless meetings'), which helps to define the scope. The emphasis is clearly on building and evolving the software platform that leverages AI, rather than deep AI model work."
