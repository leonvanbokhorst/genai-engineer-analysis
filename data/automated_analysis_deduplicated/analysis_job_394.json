It lacks any descriptive text regarding responsibilities, required skills, or technologies. Therefore, it is impossible to classify any job tasks, technologies, or soft skills based on the provided 'Coding Book'. As a result, the role cannot be meaningfully assigned to any of the defined profiles, and 'Not Relevant' is the most appropriate classification due to the lack of information."
