        "rationale": "The job advertisement focuses heavily on traditional software engineering tasks (1.A.1), such as writing high-performance, scalable code, implementing integrations, and delivering game systems. While AI is mentioned as a component to be integrated ('integrate AI and real-time data processing'), the core responsibilities and emphasis are on the software development and engineering aspects rather than the development or specialization of AI models themselves. The role is about building software that *uses* AI, not about being an AI specialist. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

The distinction between focusing on engineering excellence versus AI model development is explicitly stated, making the classification straightforward."
