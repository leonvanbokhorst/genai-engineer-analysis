While it mentions leveraging and fine-tuning existing models, it explicitly states 'not building new AI models from scratch.' The core responsibilities revolve around software development, process improvement using AI, and creating frameworks for AI integration, aligning with Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering) with a significant AI component, but without the deep model development or specialization typical of a Core GenAI Engineer or Specialist. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."
