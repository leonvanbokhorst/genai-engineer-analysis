While it mentions 'AI applications' and 'AI concepts', it does not detail specific AI/ML model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. The core responsibilities are about building and integrating applications, with AI being a feature rather than the primary focus of development. Therefore, it aligns best with the 'Software Engineer' profile, which involves tasks predominantly from Macro-Category A without significant AI specialization."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the core responsibilities being software development using specific frameworks. However, the mention of '(AI) applications' and 'AI concepts' is somewhat vague regarding the depth of AI involvement. It's not a pure 'Software Engineer' role if AI integration is deep, but it's also not an 'AI Specialist' or 'GenAI Engineer' without more specific AI tasks mentioned. The confidence is high that it's a software engineering role, but the exact nuance of AI integration could be slightly clearer."
