While it mentions 'Leveraging AI and LLMs' for product enhancement, this is presented as one aspect of the role, not the primary focus. The core responsibilities and technologies listed are predominantly software engineering-centric. Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, where AI/ML is integrated into a software product rather than being the sole focus of the role."

The mention of AI/LLMs is present but not the dominant theme, making the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile a strong fit. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the depth of AI/LLM involvement is not extensively detailed beyond a single bullet point."
