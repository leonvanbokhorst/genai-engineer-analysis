It also includes traditional software development responsibilities like 'setting up, implementing, and optimizing solutions' (1.A.1). The mention of working with 'newest technologies' (3.2) suggests a forward-looking approach. The blend of core software engineering tasks with specific GenAI specializations, without a strong emphasis on traditional ML, points to the 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile."
