        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on core software engineering tasks related to data pipelines and infrastructure ('Macro-Category A'). While it mentions collaboration with data scientists and developing data models for machine learning, the primary responsibilities are building and maintaining the data engineering foundation. There are no specific tasks or technologies mentioned that point towards deep involvement with AI model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or generative AI concepts. Therefore, it fits the profile of a Software Engineer who works with AI/ML systems as part of their broader data engineering responsibilities."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the core responsibilities being data engineering, with a strong emphasis on building and optimizing data pipelines and infrastructure. The mention of collaboration with data scientists and supporting machine learning provides context for the AI adjacency. However, it lacks specific details on the types of AI/ML models or generative AI techniques involved, which would have made the classification even more definitive. The absence of any specific AI/ML technologies or advanced AI tasks prevents a perfect score."
