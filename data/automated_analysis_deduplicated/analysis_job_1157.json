While it mentions leveraging generative AI and creating AI-powered products like a 'learning copilot' and 'Educational Content Generation', the core responsibilities are centered around software development and integration, rather than deep model development or fine-tuning (Macro-Category B tasks). The role is about building software that *uses* AI, not necessarily building the AI models themselves. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."
