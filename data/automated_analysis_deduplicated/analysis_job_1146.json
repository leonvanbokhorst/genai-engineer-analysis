        "rationale": "The job description heavily emphasizes traditional software engineering tasks (1.A.1) such as developing, integrating, deploying applications, building features, and managing infrastructure. While it mentions AI and Generative AI (specifically RAG and GPT-4), these are presented as tools or components to be integrated into existing product lines, rather than the primary focus of model development or specialization. The role is about enhancing existing software products with AI capabilities, fitting the definition of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines a software engineering role with AI integration as a key component. The tasks are well-defined, and the technologies mentioned are specific. The profile assignment is strongly supported by the evidence. A slightly lower score is given because some tasks could be interpreted as leaning more towards AI specialization, but the overall emphasis remains on software development."
