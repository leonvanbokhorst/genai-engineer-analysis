        "rationale": "The job advertisement heavily emphasizes traditional software engineering tasks such as developing scalable applications, serverless architectures, cloud-native solutions, and conducting code reviews. While it mentions leveraging AI and integrating AI-driven solutions, it does not focus on the core development or fine-tuning of AI models themselves. The role is about enhancing existing products and engineering processes with AI, rather than building AI models from scratch or specializing deeply in generative AI techniques. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."
