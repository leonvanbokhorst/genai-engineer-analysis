Phrases like 'help train AI models', 'Crafting and answering questions related to computer science in order to help train AI models', and 'Evaluating and ranking code generated by AI models' all fall under Macro-Category B: GenAI Specialization, specifically 1.B.1 Model Development & Fine-Tuning. There are no tasks mentioned that fall under Macro-Category A: Core Software Engineering (e.g., software development, integration, MLOps). Therefore, the role is predominantly focused on AI specialization tasks, leading to the 'ML Specialist (Data Scientist)' profile, with a focus on generative AI."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the core tasks related to training and evaluating AI models. However, it lacks specific details about the technologies used or the depth of software engineering involvement, which prevents a perfect score. The profile assignment is strongly supported by the task descriptions."
