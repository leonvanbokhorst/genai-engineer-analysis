It mentions 'AI (LLM)' and 'Azure Cloud Stack' as technologies to work with, indicating integration of AI capabilities rather than deep specialization in AI model development or GenAI specific tasks like prompt engineering or RAG. The role is about building software that *uses* AI, not necessarily building the AI itself. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

The profile assignment is strong, but a slightly higher score would be warranted if there were more explicit details on the AI integration aspect."
