        "rationale": "The job ad focuses exclusively on tasks related to training and evaluating AI models ('Het maken en beantwoorden van vragen met betrekking tot informatica om AI-modellen te helpen trainen.' and 'Het evalueren en rangschikken van code die door AI-modellen wordt gegenereerd.'). These tasks fall under Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization) and specifically under 'Model Development & Fine-Tuning' (1.B.1). There are no tasks mentioned that fall under Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering). Therefore, the role is predominantly focused on AI specialization, leading to the 'ML Specialist (Data Scientist)' profile, assuming the 'AI Trainer' aspect implies a focus on traditional ML or a broad AI training role rather than specifically GenAI."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 3,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is very brief and lacks specific details about the type of AI models or the exact nature of the 'computer science' questions. While the tasks clearly point to model training and evaluation, the distinction between traditional ML and GenAI is not explicit, making the profile assignment slightly less certain. The absence of any software engineering tasks (Macro-Category A) strongly suggests a specialist role, but the exact domain of AI is inferred."
