While there are also mentions of traditional ML (classification algorithms) and data engineering (medallion architecture, data storage/annotation), the emphasis on LLMs and conversational AI, coupled with the software engineering aspects of integration and maintenance, points towards a 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile. The role is not purely a specialist in GenAI model development but rather in building and maintaining systems that leverage GenAI."

However, it could be more specific about the exact technologies used (beyond LLM and MS Copilot) and the depth of involvement in model development versus integration. The mention of 'classification algorithms' alongside LLM tasks suggests a blend, but the overall focus leans towards GenAI integration and maintenance."
