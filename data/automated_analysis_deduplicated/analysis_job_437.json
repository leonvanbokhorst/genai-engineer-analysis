While there is a mention of AI-generated summaries (a GenAI task), the overwhelming emphasis is on using AI as a tool to augment traditional software engineering, rather than specializing in the development or fine-tuning of AI models themselves. The role is about building software that *uses* AI, not necessarily building the AI models."

The distinction between building AI-powered software and building AI models is evident. However, the ad uses some metaphorical language ('superhero status', 'conjuring code like magic') which slightly reduces the absolute clarity, but the core responsibilities are well-defined."
