While it mentions diverse data projects including NLP, time series, and image recognition, it does not specify any tasks or technologies related to Generative AI (like LLMs, RAG, prompt engineering). The role is described as a 'Data Engineer/developer' and emphasizes working with data architecture and solving business problems through data insights, aligning with Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering) without significant tasks from Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization). Therefore, the 'Software Engineer' profile is the most appropriate fit."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is reasonably clear about the core responsibilities being data engineering and software development. However, it lacks specific details about the AI/ML technologies used, and the mention of NLP, time series, and image recognition could imply some ML focus, but not specifically GenAI. The absence of any GenAI-specific terms makes it lean towards a general software engineering role with a data focus."
