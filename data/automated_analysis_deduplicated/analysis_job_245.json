While there's a mention of integrating AI solutions into existing products (1.A.1), the core focus and the majority of tasks fall under 'GenAI Specialization' (Macro-Category B). The role also includes strategic contributions and communication of AI concepts. Given the strong emphasis on GenAI-specific tasks and the balance between model development/fine-tuning and prompt engineering/RAG, the 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile is the most appropriate."
