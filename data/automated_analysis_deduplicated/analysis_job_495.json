While 'GenAI features' are mentioned, the core responsibilities revolve around offensive security engineering, which is a specialized application of software engineering principles to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities. The tasks are predominantly within Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration), with no specific tasks related to developing, fine-tuning, or prompt engineering of AI models themselves (Macro-Category B). Therefore, it fits the profile of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer who works with software that incorporates AI, but the role's primary function is not AI development or specialization."
