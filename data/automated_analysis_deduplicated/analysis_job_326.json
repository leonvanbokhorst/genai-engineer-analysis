There are no explicit mentions of traditional software development tasks (Macro-Category A). While it mentions 'experienced software engineer', the core responsibilities are AI-centric and do not involve building or integrating AI into software products. Therefore, the 'GenAI Specialist' profile is the most appropriate fit."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines tasks related to AI model training and evaluation, making the classification of job tasks straightforward. However, the ad is brief and does not detail specific technologies or extensive software engineering practices, which slightly limits the confidence in assigning a very specific profile beyond the core AI focus. The mention of 'experienced software engineer' could imply some underlying software engineering skills, but the described tasks are predominantly AI specialization."
