        "rationale": "The job ad heavily emphasizes traditional software engineering tasks (1.A.1), such as coding, architecture design, and developing reusable assets. While it mentions AI offerings like Azure ML and Azure OpenAI, it explicitly states 'This is not a data scientist role' and that a data science team will partner with the engineer. The focus is on integrating and building solutions around AI, rather than developing or fine-tuning AI models themselves. The role involves understanding user requirements and business challenges (1.C.1) and requires strong collaboration (3.1) and a growth mindset (3.2). Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer who builds software that uses AI features."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 5,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is very clear about the nature of the role, explicitly stating it's not a data scientist role and focusing on software engineering aspects. The responsibilities and required skills align well with the definition of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, making the classification straightforward."
