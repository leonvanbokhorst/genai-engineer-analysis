        "rationale": "The job advertisement focuses exclusively on DevOps and operational tasks related to software development and deployment, specifically mentioning 'AI applications' but without detailing any tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. The mention of 'OOP' and 'Artificial Intelligence' are general technical skills, not specific AI/ML model tasks. Therefore, the role is classified as a Software Engineer with a focus on the operational aspects of AI applications, rather than an AI/ML specialist or engineer."

This makes it straightforward to classify the core tasks but leaves room for interpretation regarding the depth of AI involvement. The mention of 'OOP' and 'AI' are broad. The confidence is high for the DevOps aspect but moderate for definitively excluding any AI model-specific tasks."
