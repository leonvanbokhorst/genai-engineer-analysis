        "rationale": "The job advertisement focuses heavily on offensive security engineering tasks, which are primarily related to software development and integration (Macro-Category A). While it mentions 'GenAI features' in the context of devices, the core responsibilities and tasks described (security research, red-teaming, exploit demonstration, proposing solutions, automation of security work) do not involve the development, fine-tuning, or specific application of Generative AI models themselves. The role is about securing systems that *may* use GenAI, rather than building or specializing in GenAI. Therefore, it fits the 'Software Engineer' profile, specifically within a security engineering domain."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the nature of the role being offensive security engineering. The mention of 'GenAI features' is contextual to the devices being secured, not the core function of the role. The tasks described are firmly within traditional software engineering and security practices. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the mention of GenAI, even if contextual, requires careful interpretation to ensure it doesn't imply a GenAI specialization."
