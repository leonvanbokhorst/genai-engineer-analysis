Crucially, it also explicitly demands familiarity and implementation experience with Generative AI concepts such as LLMs, vector databases, and toolcalling (Macro-Category B tasks). This balance of strong software engineering fundamentals with specific GenAI implementation skills points to a 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile."

It mentions specific GenAI technologies (LLMs, vector databases, toolcalling) and traditional development languages (TypeScript, Python). The confidence is high, but not perfect (5), as it could benefit from more detail on the specific types of applications or the balance between development and AI specialization tasks."
