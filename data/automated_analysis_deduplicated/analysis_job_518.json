While it mentions 'AI and Machine learning, GenAI and Natural language processing' in the context of fixing issues, the core of the role appears to be the development and deployment of automation solutions (using UiPath) rather than the core development or specialization in AI/ML models themselves. The emphasis is on integrating and maintaining these automations, which are likely AI-enhanced, into the business structure. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile, where AI/ML is a component of the software being built and maintained, but not the primary focus of development."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is reasonably clear about the tasks involved, particularly the use of UiPath for automation. However, the mention of 'AI and Machine learning, GenAI and Natural language processing' is within the context of 'fixing issues', which is slightly ambiguous regarding the depth of AI involvement. The primary focus seems to be on automation engineering, making the AI aspect a supporting element rather than the core of the role. The profile assignment is strong, but a slightly higher confidence would require more explicit detail on the AI/ML development tasks themselves."
