There are no mentions of traditional software development, integration, or MLOps tasks (Macro-Category A). While it mentions 'Back-End Ontwikkelaar' in the title, the description clarifies the role is about training AI models by providing feedback, which aligns with a specialist role in GenAI."

However, the title 'Back-End Ontwikkelaar' is slightly misleading given the actual responsibilities described, which lean heavily towards AI specialization rather than traditional software engineering. The lack of explicit mention of software development tasks (Macro-Category A) makes the 'Specialist' profile more fitting than 'Engineer'."
