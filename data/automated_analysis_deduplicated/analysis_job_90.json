Tasks like building data pipelines for these models, training them on GPU clusters, and conducting cutting-edge research are central. While there's mention of collaboration and presenting work (soft skills), the core responsibilities are focused on the 'B' category of GenAI Specialization, specifically model development and data engineering for these models, rather than integrating them into existing software products (Macro-Category A). There is no mention of software development or integration into user-facing applications."
