        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on implementing, configuring, and maintaining systems (Macro-Category A tasks) that leverage AI for operational efficiency. While AI is mentioned as a tool and a system to be managed, the core responsibilities are rooted in traditional software engineering and operations (scripting, system configuration, incident management, network function management). There are no explicit tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B tasks). Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, where AI is integrated into the product/operations but the primary focus is on the engineering and operational aspects."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the responsibilities and distinguishes itself from traditional engineering roles. It emphasizes the use of AI as a tool for operational improvement rather than core AI/ML model development. The tasks described align well with the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile. However, the specific AI tools or models are not detailed, and the description of 'AI System Building' could be interpreted in multiple ways, slightly reducing certainty."
