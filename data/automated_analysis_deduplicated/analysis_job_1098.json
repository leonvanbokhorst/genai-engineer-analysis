The role leans heavily towards operational and system integration tasks, making the profile assignment straightforward. A slightly lower score is given because the specific AI technologies or frameworks are not detailed, and the 'AI-driven systems' could be interpreted in various ways, but the core engineering tasks are well-defined."
