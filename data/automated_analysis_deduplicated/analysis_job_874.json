It also includes MLOps/DevOps tasks (1.A.2) for CI/CD pipelines. While AI is mentioned ('AI-driven solutions'), the core of the role is integrating these into existing business systems (Salesforce) and managing the software development lifecycle, rather than developing or specializing in AI/ML models themselves. There are no specific AI/ML model development or GenAI specialization tasks mentioned. Therefore, it fits the profile of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer who builds or maintains software that uses AI features."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering and CI/CD responsibilities. The mention of 'AI-driven solutions' is present but not detailed, and the focus remains on the Salesforce platform. The role appears to be a software engineering role that leverages AI, rather than a core AI/ML role. The confidence is high, but not perfect, due to the slight ambiguity in the depth of AI involvement."
