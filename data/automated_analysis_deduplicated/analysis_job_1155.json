While it mentions leveraging AI and generative AI for product features (TeachTap, Coachbot, content generation), it does not detail specific AI model development, fine-tuning, or prompt engineering tasks (Macro-Category B). The role is about integrating AI into software products rather than specializing in AI model creation. The technologies listed (Angular, React, AWS) are standard software development tools. Therefore, the profile of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, which focuses on Macro-Category A with AI integration, is the most fitting."
