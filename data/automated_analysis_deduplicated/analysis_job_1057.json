While there's a mention of knowledge transfer for scalability (1.A.2) and analyzing project requirements (1.C.1), the core responsibilities are centered around the GenAI model interaction and adaptation. There are no tasks related to traditional software development (Macro-Category A), making 'GenAI Specialist' the most appropriate profile."
