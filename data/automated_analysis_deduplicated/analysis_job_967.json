        "rationale": "The job ad focuses exclusively on tasks related to training and evaluating generative AI models ('help train AI models', 'Evaluating and ranking code generated by AI models'). There are no mentions of core software engineering tasks like building applications, MLOps, or integrating AI into existing systems (Macro-Category A). The tasks are purely within the AI specialization (Macro-Category B) and specifically related to Generative AI. Therefore, 'GenAI Specialist' is the most appropriate profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines tasks related to AI model training and evaluation, specifically for generative AI. However, it is quite brief and lacks detail on the specific technologies or the broader software engineering context, which prevents a perfect score. The focus on 'training AI models' and 'evaluating code generated by AI models' strongly points towards a specialist role."
