The ad explicitly states it's not for those who specialize in a single aspect and emphasizes integrating AI across systems. This balance between core software engineering (Macro-Category A) and Generative AI specialization (Macro-Category B), with a focus on LLMs, aligns best with the 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile."

The 'What you will NOT be doing' section further clarifies the scope, reinforcing the blend of responsibilities. This alignment between responsibilities and defined profiles makes the analysis straightforward."
