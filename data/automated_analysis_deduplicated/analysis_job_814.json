While 'ML Platform' suggests a connection to machine learning, the primary focus on 'Frontend' and the absence of any descriptive text about responsibilities or required skills makes it impossible to classify the role according to the provided coding book. There are no discernible tasks related to Core Software Engineering (Macro-Category A) or GenAI Specialization (Macro-Category B)."
