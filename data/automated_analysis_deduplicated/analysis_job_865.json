        "rationale": "The job ad primarily focuses on 'Designing and building high-quality AI automations' and 'Architecting and deploying sophisticated, fully-automated AI systems' (Macro-Category A tasks). While it mentions experimenting with AI tools like GPT-4 Vision and optimizing AI solutions (elements of Macro-Category B and Operations), the core emphasis is on building and integrating these into broader applications and systems. The role is about leveraging AI to enhance existing software development processes and deliver scalable solutions, rather than specializing deeply in model development or GenAI-specific tasks like prompt engineering or RAG. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering responsibilities with an AI component. The tasks are well-defined, and the mention of specific AI tools helps in classification. However, it's not a deep dive into GenAI-specific tasks, making the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile a strong fit but not definitively exclusive of other interpretations without more context on the 'AI automations' themselves."
