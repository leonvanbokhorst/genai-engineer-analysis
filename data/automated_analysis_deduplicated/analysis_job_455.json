While it mentions 'Data Science/ML' in the title and 'Big Data Analytics advisor', the core responsibilities described are about demonstrating and integrating a platform, rather than developing or fine-tuning AI/ML models themselves (Macro-Category B). The role is about enabling customers to use the Databricks platform, which includes its AI/ML capabilities, but the engineer's primary function is not the AI/ML model development itself. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to software integration, demonstration, and advisory roles within a data platform context. While 'Data Science/ML' is mentioned, the tasks described lean more towards the application and integration of these capabilities rather than their core development. The profile assignment is strong, but a slightly higher score would be warranted if there were more explicit mentions of AI/ML model development tasks to differentiate it further from a pure software engineer role."
