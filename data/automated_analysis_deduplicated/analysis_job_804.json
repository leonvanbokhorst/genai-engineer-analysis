Business Understanding & Strategy), both falling under Macro-Category A or overarching skills. There are no explicit tasks identified from Macro-Category B (AI Specialization). Therefore, the role is classified as AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, as it involves building products that are AI-powered. The 'GEN AI' in the title likely refers to the domain of these AI-powered products."
