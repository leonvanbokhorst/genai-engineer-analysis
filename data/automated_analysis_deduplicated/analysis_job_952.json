Phrases like 'help train AI models', 'train generative artificial intelligence models', and 'Evaluating and ranking code generated by AI models' clearly fall under Macro-Category B: GenAI Specialization. There are no tasks mentioned that fall under Macro-Category A: Core Software Engineering. Therefore, the role is predominantly focused on the AI specialization aspect, leading to the 'ML Specialist (Data Scientist)' profile, with a specific emphasis on Generative AI tasks."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the core tasks involved in training and evaluating AI models. However, it lacks specific technical tool mentions and doesn't detail the software engineering aspects that would be present in a more integrated role. The profile assignment is strong based on the described tasks, but the absence of technical details prevents a perfect score."
