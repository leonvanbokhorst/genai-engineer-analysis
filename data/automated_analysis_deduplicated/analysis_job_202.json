This aligns with Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering) tasks, specifically Software Development & Integration, without detailing specific AI model development or GenAI specialization tasks (Macro-Category B). The role appears to be about building software that leverages AI, rather than specializing in AI model creation or GenAI techniques."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is extremely brief and lacks specific details about the AI technologies or the nature of the AI systems to be developed. While it points towards software engineering with an AI component, it's difficult to definitively classify the depth of AI involvement or specific AI specializations. The mention of 'AI systems' is broad, and the lack of any mention of specific tools or methodologies makes a precise classification challenging."
