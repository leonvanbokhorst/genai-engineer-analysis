        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on traditional software engineering tasks related to mobile app development using Flutter and Dart. While it mentions interacting with an 'AI-powered platform' and a reference to Generative AI in the engineering head's piece, the core responsibilities and required skills are centered around software development (Macro-Category A) and do not involve direct work with AI/ML models, prompt engineering, or data for AI. Therefore, it fits the 'Software Engineer' profile."
