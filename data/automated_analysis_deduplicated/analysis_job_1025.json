        "rationale": "The job advertisement exclusively details tasks related to traditional software development, such as designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software. It mentions C++ as the primary programming language and NX CAM as the software product. There is no mention of any AI, ML, or Generative AI specific tasks, models, frameworks, or tools. This aligns perfectly with the definition of a \"Software Engineer\" profile, which focuses solely on Macro-Category A tasks without AI/ML integration."
