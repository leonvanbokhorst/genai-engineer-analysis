        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on tasks related to training, evaluating, and interacting with generative AI models, specifically in the context of code generation. While it mentions 'experienced software engineer', the core responsibilities described (1.B.1) are predominantly AI specialization tasks, with no mention of traditional software development (1.A.1) or MLOps (1.A.2). The role is about providing feedback and evaluating AI output, which aligns with a specialist role rather than an engineer who builds the surrounding infrastructure or integrates AI into larger applications. Therefore, 'GenAI Specialist' is the most fitting profile."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the core tasks related to training and evaluating generative AI models. However, it is a bit light on specific technical details or the broader software engineering context that might be expected for an engineer profile. The emphasis is clearly on the AI interaction and feedback loop, making the 'GenAI Specialist' profile highly probable, but the lack of detail on the 'software engineering' aspect prevents a perfect score."
