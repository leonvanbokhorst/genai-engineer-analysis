        "rationale": "The job ad primarily focuses on software engineering tasks (developing back-end solutions, code reviews, integrating AI into products) with an emphasis on using AI tools to improve the software development process itself. There are no explicit tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. The role is about building software that leverages AI tools for efficiency and integrates AI-driven innovations, rather than building or specializing in AI models themselves. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."
