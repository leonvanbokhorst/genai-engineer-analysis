        "rationale": "The job ad primarily focuses on traditional software engineering tasks (1.A.1) such as translating business processes into applications, working with Python, AWS Serverless, CI/CD, and microservices. While it mentions 'data science and generative AI' and the goal to 'make great strides' in these areas, it does not detail specific tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). The role is described as a Senior Software Developer and Senior Full-Stack Developer, indicating the primary function is building and integrating, rather than specializing in AI model creation. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile, where AI/ML is a component integrated into the software platform."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the core software engineering responsibilities and technologies. The mention of 'generative AI' is present but not detailed in terms of specific tasks, which slightly reduces confidence in assigning a more specialized AI profile. However, the overall emphasis on software development and integration is strong."
