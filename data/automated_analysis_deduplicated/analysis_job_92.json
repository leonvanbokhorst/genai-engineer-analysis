        "rationale": "The job title is 'MLOps Engineer' and the core responsibilities revolve around implementing and maintaining ML infrastructure and workflows (1.A.2). While it mentions generative AI and NLP specialists, the primary focus is on the operational and engineering aspects of ML systems rather than the development or fine-tuning of the models themselves (which would fall under Macro-Category B). The role also involves ensuring the transition from development to production (1.A.1). The soft skills indicate collaboration and openness to new technologies. There is no explicit mention of core GenAI tasks like prompt engineering or model development, suggesting the role is about supporting AI/ML systems within a broader software engineering context."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly identifies the role as 'MLOps Engineer' and outlines responsibilities related to infrastructure and workflows. The mention of 'generative AI' and 'NLP specialists' provides context, but the core tasks are firmly rooted in MLOps (Macro-Category A). The soft skills are also clearly stated. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the specific nature of the 'generative AI' focus could be more detailed, and the absence of explicit technology mentions leaves some room for interpretation."
