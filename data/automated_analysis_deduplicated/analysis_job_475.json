While it mentions 'large language models' in the introductory paragraph, the core responsibilities and required expertise (computer architecture, accelerators, quantization, toolchains, performance analysis) are deeply rooted in traditional ML performance engineering rather than generative AI specific tasks like prompt engineering or RAG. The role involves developing and optimizing software and hardware systems for ML workloads, which leans towards both software engineering (Macro-Category A) and ML specialization (Macro-Category B). Given the emphasis on performance optimization of ML models and systems, and the lack of specific generative AI tasks, it fits the 'Core ML Engineer' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite specific about the technical requirements related to ML performance, hardware, and toolchains. However, the initial mention of 'large language models' without further elaboration on their specific use in the role creates a slight ambiguity. The core responsibilities are clearly defined, but the context of LLMs could be more explicit to differentiate from a purely traditional ML performance role. The classification leans towards traditional ML due to the detailed focus on hardware and performance optimization aspects."
