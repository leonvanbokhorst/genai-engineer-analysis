        "rationale": "The job description emphasizes traditional software engineering tasks such as system configuration, maintenance, incident management, and the implementation/design of AI-driven systems. While AI tools are mentioned, the core responsibilities revolve around integrating and managing these systems within existing infrastructure (network functions) to improve operational efficiency. There is no mention of model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. The role is about using AI as a tool to enhance existing processes, rather than developing AI models themselves, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the responsibilities, focusing on system integration and operational tasks using AI tools. It explicitly states what the role is NOT, which helps in classification. However, it lacks specific technical tool mentions, which would have increased confidence further. The distinction between using AI tools and developing AI models is clear enough to assign a profile with high confidence."
