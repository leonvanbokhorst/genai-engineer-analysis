The primary responsibilities involve operating, maintaining, and troubleshooting network infrastructure, hardware, and operating systems. While it mentions 'high-performance machine-learning clusters', the role's focus is on the network supporting these clusters, not on the AI/ML models themselves. The tasks fall squarely within Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering), with specific emphasis on 1.A.1 (Software Development & Integration) and 1.A.2 (Operations & MLOps). There are no tasks related to AI/ML model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). Therefore, the most appropriate profile is 'Software Engineer'."

The distinction between supporting ML clusters and working on ML models is clear."
