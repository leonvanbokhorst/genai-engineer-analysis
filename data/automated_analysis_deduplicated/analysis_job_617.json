It also includes operational aspects related to deploying LLMs (1.A.2). While LLMs are mentioned, the core responsibilities are centered around the software engineering aspects of building and deploying applications that *use* LLMs, rather than the deep specialization in model development or prompt engineering itself. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software development and integration tasks, and mentions LLM deployment. However, it lacks specific details on the *type* of LLM work or the depth of AI specialization required, making it slightly less definitive than a role explicitly detailing model training or advanced prompt engineering. The focus is more on the engineering surrounding the LLM integration."
