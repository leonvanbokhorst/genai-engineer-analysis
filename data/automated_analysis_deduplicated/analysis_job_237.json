        "rationale": "The job title 'Founding Software Engineer' does not contain any explicit mention of AI or Machine Learning. Based on the provided definitions, the `Software Engineer` profile is assigned to roles exclusively focused on Macro-Category A tasks without AI/ML integration. While the 'Founding' aspect implies broad responsibilities, the absence of AI/ML keywords in the title leads to this classification as a default, acknowledging the severe lack of descriptive content."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 1,
        "reasoning": "The job advertisement is extremely minimal, providing only a title. There is no descriptive text detailing job tasks, technologies, or skills, making a robust analysis impossible. The profile assignment is based solely on the title's implication of a general software engineering role, and the confidence is very low due to the lack of information."
