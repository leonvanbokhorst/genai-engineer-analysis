While it mentions leveraging AI tools and integrating AI-driven solutions, it does not detail core AI model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. The focus is on using AI to enhance existing software products and engineer processes, rather than on the AI models themselves. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."
