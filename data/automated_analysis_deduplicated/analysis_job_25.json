        "rationale": "The job advertisement is extremely brief and only states 'Front End Developer'. It provides no details regarding AI/ML tasks, technologies, or responsibilities. The `CODING_BOOK.md` is specifically designed for analyzing roles within the AI/ML domain. As there is no AI/ML context in the provided ad, it cannot be classified into any of the defined AI/ML profiles and is therefore considered 'Not Relevant' to the scope of this coding book."

        "score": 1,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is too minimal to perform any meaningful analysis against the detailed `CODING_BOOK.md`. It lacks any descriptive text about tasks, technologies, or skills, making it impossible to classify beyond identifying it as not relevant to the AI/ML focus of the book."
