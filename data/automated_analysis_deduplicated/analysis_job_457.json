The role acts as a bridge between legal and technology, supporting the business by applying technology. There is no mention of specific GenAI models, frameworks, or deep ML model development tasks. The role is primarily about applying technology to business problems, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

It emphasizes integration, process improvement, and collaboration. While it mentions AI and generative AI, it doesn't delve into the specifics of model building or deep AI research, making the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile a strong fit. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the exact technical depth of 'developing these tools' is not fully detailed, leaving a slight ambiguity about whether it involves deep AI model work or more application-level development."
