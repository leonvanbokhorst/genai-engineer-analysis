        "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on tasks related to Generative AI (LLMs) and traditional ML model prototyping (1.B.1, 1.B.2) and data analysis (1.B.3). While it mentions 'Software Engineer' in the title, the core responsibilities are centered around AI/ML tasks rather than general software development or integration (Macro-Category A). There's no mention of software development, integration, or MLOps tasks. Therefore, the role is best classified as a GenAI Specialist due to the explicit mention and focus on LLMs."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the AI/ML tasks involved, particularly the use of LLMs and ML model prototyping. However, it's an internship description, so the depth of 'software engineering' aspects is naturally limited. The confidence is high for the AI/ML task classification, but slightly lower for definitively ruling out any underlying software engineering integration, though none is explicitly stated."
