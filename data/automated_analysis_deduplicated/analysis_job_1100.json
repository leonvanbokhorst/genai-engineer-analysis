While AI is mentioned as a tool to enhance these processes ('AI-driven systems', 'AI tools'), the core responsibilities do not involve developing or fine-tuning AI models themselves (Macro-Category B).

It explicitly states it's not a traditional engineering or support role but combines technical work with AI tools. The distinction between using AI as a tool versus developing AI models is clear. The confidence is high, but not perfect (5), as the term 'AI System Building' could be interpreted slightly more broadly, though the context strongly suggests integration rather than core model development."
