While 'generative AI' is mentioned in the introduction as part of the R&D process, the specific tasks and responsibilities detailed for the engineer do not involve direct work with generative models, prompt engineering, or fine-tuning. The role is about building the software infrastructure that supports the R&D process, which includes ML Ops, but not the core AI model development itself. Therefore, it fits the profile of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, where software engineering is the primary focus, and AI/ML is a component that the software interacts with or supports."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering responsibilities and mentions AI/ML in a supporting context. However, the initial mention of 'generative AI' in the R&D description is not directly translated into specific tasks for this role, making the AI focus slightly ambiguous. The core tasks are clearly software development, leading to a confident assignment of 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer'."
