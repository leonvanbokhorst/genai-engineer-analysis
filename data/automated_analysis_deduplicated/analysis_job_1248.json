        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on building products and tools based on 'predictive modeling, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, LLMs'. While LLMs are mentioned, the emphasis on predictive modeling and traditional ML techniques, alongside the examples like 'prepayment forecasting model' and 'Document Data extraction', suggests a stronger leaning towards traditional ML. The role also involves integrating these models into products and collaborating with business units, indicating a balance between ML specialization (Macro-Category B) and software development/business understanding (Macro-Category A). However, the core tasks described are more aligned with traditional ML than exclusively Generative AI."

It clearly mentions various ML techniques and the process of building and implementing products. However, it could be more specific about the day-to-day tasks and the exact balance between traditional ML and GenAI, which leads to a slightly less than perfect confidence score."
