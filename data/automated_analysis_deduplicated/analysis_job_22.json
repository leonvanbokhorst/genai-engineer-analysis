                "justification": "This part specifies that the integration is with AI/ML systems, but the act of integration itself falls under software development and integration. The role is building 'around' and 'integrating with' these AI components, rather than developing the AI models themselves."

        "rationale": "The job description focuses entirely on backend engineering tasks related to system scalability and reliability (1.A.1. Software Development & Integration). While it mentions integration with LLM and traditional AI models, it does not describe any tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or data engineering for AI models (Macro-Category B). This indicates the role is primarily a software engineering position that supports or integrates AI/ML functionalities, fitting the AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is clear about the core responsibilities being backend engineering and the context being AI/LLM integration. However, it lacks specific details on technologies or the depth of AI involvement, which prevents a perfect score."
