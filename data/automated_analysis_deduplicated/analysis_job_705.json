While there's mention of AI model fine-tuning and feedback, the core emphasis is on the application and enhancement of existing AI capabilities within a support system, rather than core AI model development or specialized GenAI tasks. The role involves using AI as a tool to augment a software-based support system, fitting the profile of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines tasks related to AI integration and improvement within a support system. While it mentions 'AI model fine-tuning', the overall context points more towards applying and refining AI within a software engineering framework rather than deep AI research or development. The 'What you will NOT be doing' section also provides context about the role's focus. The confidence is high, but not perfect, as the term 'fine-tuning' could imply deeper ML work, but the surrounding tasks suggest integration and support."
