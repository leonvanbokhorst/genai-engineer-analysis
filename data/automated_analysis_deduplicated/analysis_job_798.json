While it mentions 'generative AI' in a question about ethical deployment, the core responsibilities described are rooted in traditional ML. The role also emphasizes developing end-to-end solutions and operationalizing them for production, indicating a blend of ML specialization (Macro-Category B) and software development/integration (Macro-Category A). Given the strong emphasis on traditional ML tasks and the mention of operationalizing solutions, 'Core ML Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines traditional ML tasks and the need for operationalizing solutions. The mention of generative AI is in the context of a question about ethical deployment, not as a primary task. This makes the classification of the role as 'Core ML Engineer' quite confident, though the mention of GenAI prevents a perfect score."
