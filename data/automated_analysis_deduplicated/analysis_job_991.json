        "rationale": "The role focuses on tasks directly related to training Generative AI models, specifically by providing human feedback through crafting questions and evaluating AI-generated code. These activities fall under the preparation and evaluation of data for AI training (Macro-Category B), aligning with the definition of a GenAI Specialist who is predominantly focused on GenAI tasks. The ad explicitly states 'no requirement for previous AI experience' and leverages 'coding expertise' for training, indicating the core contribution is in the data/feedback aspect of GenAI training rather than core software engineering or deep model development."
    },
    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly defines the core activity as providing human feedback for GenAI training. However, it lacks specific technical details and mentions a 'Big Data Engineer' title which might suggest broader data engineering responsibilities not explicitly detailed in the responsibilities. The tasks described are more about data annotation/generation than traditional software engineering or deep model development."
