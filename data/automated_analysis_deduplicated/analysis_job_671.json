While AI and GenAI are central to the features being built (e.g., RAG, GPT-4, generative AI), the core responsibility is the software engineering aspect of integrating these AI capabilities into existing products and building robust applications. The role is not focused on deep model research or development (Macro-Category B), but rather on leveraging AI as a component within software development (Macro-Category A). The tasks are predominantly from Macro-Category A, with AI being the technology being integrated, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."
