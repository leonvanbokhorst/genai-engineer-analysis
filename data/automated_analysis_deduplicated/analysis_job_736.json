        "rationale": "The job advertisement focuses heavily on Azure cloud services, IaC, CI/CD pipelines, scripting (Python, Bash, PowerShell), and general system configuration, monitoring, and maintenance. While it mentions exploring GenAI, LLM, and Copilots, these are presented as areas for exploration rather than core responsibilities. The primary tasks fall under Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering), with no explicit tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). Therefore, the role is classified as a 'Software Engineer' with an interest in AI technologies."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to Azure infrastructure, DevOps, and scripting. The mention of GenAI/LLM is exploratory rather than a core requirement, making the classification straightforward. However, the 'Lead' aspect implies some strategic input, and the depth of 'exploration' into GenAI is not fully detailed, preventing a perfect score."
