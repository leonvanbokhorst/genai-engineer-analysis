        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on tasks directly related to training and evaluating generative AI models, such as helping models write better code, creating questions for training, and evaluating generated code. While it mentions software engineering expertise, the core responsibilities are centered around the AI model's learning process rather than integrating AI into a larger software product or building the software infrastructure around it. Therefore, it aligns best with a 'GenAI Specialist' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines tasks related to AI model training and evaluation, specifically for generative AI. The language is direct about the nature of the work. However, it's not a deeply technical description of the AI models themselves, and it doesn't mention specific tools or frameworks, which prevents a perfect score. The profile assignment is strongly supported by the described tasks."
