        "rationale": "The job title 'Software Engineer' clearly indicates that the role's primary focus is on software development and integration (Macro-Category A). The inclusion of 'ML Threat Detection' signifies that the software being developed or maintained will incorporate Machine Learning capabilities as a core part of its functionality. This aligns with the definition of an 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer', which is a role predominantly in Macro-Category A that integrates AI/ML features into a product."

        "reasoning": "The job advertisement is extremely concise, consisting only of a title. This lack of detail prevents a comprehensive analysis of job tasks, required technologies, or soft skills. The classification and profile assignment are based solely on the interpretation of the title, leading to a very low confidence score."
