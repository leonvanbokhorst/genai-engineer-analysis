        "rationale": "The job ad describes a mix of core software engineering tasks (building evaluation tools, data pipelines, production systems, code reviews) and AI/ML specialization tasks (fine-tuning AI/ML models). The specialization is focused on 'response quality' and 'AI/ML models' without explicit mention of Generative AI specific concepts like LLMs, RAG, or prompt engineering. Therefore, it leans towards a traditional ML Engineer role."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the tasks involved, providing specific examples. However, it lacks explicit mention of specific technologies or frameworks, and the 'AI/ML' focus is general rather than specifically GenAI, which slightly limits the certainty in distinguishing between a Core ML Engineer and a more general AI Engineer if the 'AI/ML models' were indeed generative."
