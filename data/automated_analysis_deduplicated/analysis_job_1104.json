While AI is central to the tasks, the role emphasizes the integration and management of these systems within existing infrastructure rather than the core development or fine-tuning of AI models themselves. The tasks described fall predominantly under Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering), specifically 'Software Development & Integration', with no explicit mention of model development, prompt engineering, or traditional ML tasks (Macro-Category B). Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

It explicitly states it's not a traditional engineering role but combines technical work with AI tools. The tasks are consistently aligned with software engineering and integration, with no indication of deep AI model development. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the term 'AI System Building' could be interpreted slightly more broadly, though the subsequent examples clarify the scope."
