The mention of 'GenAI' is present but not detailed enough to classify it as a Core GenAI Engineer or GenAI Specialist. The HR leadership aspect is also a significant part of the role. The confidence is high for the software engineering aspects but moderate for the precise AI/GenAI involvement due to lack of specific GenAI tasks."
