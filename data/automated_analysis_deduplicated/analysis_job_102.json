While it mentions 'LLM mission-critical applications', the role itself is about building the platform and infrastructure for these applications, not developing or fine-tuning the LLMs themselves, nor engaging in prompt engineering or RAG. The tasks are predominantly from Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering) with no specific tasks from Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization). Therefore, it fits the 'Software Engineer' profile."

The mention of LLM applications is in the context of the platform being built, not the core tasks of the engineer. There is no ambiguity regarding the role's focus on traditional software engineering principles."
