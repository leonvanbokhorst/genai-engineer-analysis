It also mentions integrating results via 'microservices' (1.A.1). The emphasis on LLMs and GenAI in model development, combined with core ML engineering tasks like pipelines and integration, points towards a balanced role. The mention of 'training and coaching' and 'collaborating' also indicates soft skills (3.1). Given the explicit mention of LLMs and GenAI as the core technology for model creation, the 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile is the most fitting."
