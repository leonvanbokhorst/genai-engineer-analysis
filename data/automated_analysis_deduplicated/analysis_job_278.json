        "rationale": "The role involves a significant blend of core software engineering tasks (data pipelines, Linux server management) and AI specialization tasks. Specifically, the mention of 'GenAI Suite' and 'Klus Coach' (a generative AI assistant) points towards Generative AI. The inclusion of Data Engineering (Snowflake, Dataiku) and supporting data science initiatives further solidifies the 'Core' aspect, while the explicit mention of generative AI projects leans it towards 'GenAI Engineer' rather than a traditional ML Engineer."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to both data engineering/infrastructure and specific generative AI projects. While the exact nature of the 'GenAI Suite' and 'Klus Coach' isn't detailed, their explicit mention as generative AI applications is strong evidence. The inclusion of Dataiku and Snowflake also clearly defines the data engineering aspect. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as there's no explicit mention of model fine-tuning or advanced prompt engineering techniques, which would make the GenAI focus even more pronounced."
