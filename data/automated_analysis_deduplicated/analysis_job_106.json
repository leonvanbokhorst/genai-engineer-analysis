There is no mention of AI/ML model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or generative AI specific tasks. The role is primarily about managing and making data accessible and the infrastructure for it, which aligns with a Software Engineer profile focused on data infrastructure and operations, rather than an AI/ML specialist or engineer."

There are no ambiguous terms or mentions of AI/ML tasks that would suggest a different profile. The tasks clearly fall into the 'Core Software Engineering' macro-category, specifically data engineering and operations."
