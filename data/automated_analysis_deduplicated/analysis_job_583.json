        "rationale": "The job ad heavily emphasizes traditional software engineering tasks such as designing, developing, and scaling platforms and services, conducting code reviews, and mentoring. While it mentions leveraging AI models and algorithms to transform threat defense, the core focus remains on building the platform and services that *use* these AI capabilities. The role is not primarily about developing or fine-tuning the AI models themselves (which would lean towards Specialist or Core Engineer), but rather integrating and scaling AI-driven solutions within a broader software engineering context. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering responsibilities and mentions the use of AI/ML. However, it doesn't go into deep detail about the specific AI models or frameworks to be used, making it slightly less precise than a perfect score. The emphasis is clearly on the engineering aspect of building an AI-powered platform."
