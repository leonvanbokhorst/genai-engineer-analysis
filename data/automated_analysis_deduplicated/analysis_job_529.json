        "rationale": "The job ad primarily focuses on traditional software engineering tasks (writing clean code, integrating features, improving scalability, taking responsibility for solutions) which fall under Macro-Category A. While 'OpenAI & LLM' are mentioned in the technologies, there are no specific tasks described that involve deep engagement with Generative AI models such as prompt engineering, fine-tuning, or RAG development. The role is about building and maintaining software that may *use* AI, but the core responsibilities are software engineering. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines traditional software engineering responsibilities. The mention of 'OpenAI & LLM' is present but not elaborated upon with specific generative AI tasks. This makes the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile highly probable, but a slightly lower score is given because the extent of AI integration is not deeply detailed, leaving a small room for interpretation."
