While GenAI is mentioned as a focus area for the applications being developed, there are no tasks described that involve the development, fine-tuning, or specialized application of AI/ML models themselves (Macro-Category B). This indicates the role is primarily about integrating AI/GenAI features into a software product, fitting the definition of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."
