While it mentions 'integrating AI' and 'real-time data processing', these are described as features within the game development context rather than core AI/ML model development or specialization. The emphasis is on building robust, scalable, and high-quality code for the game itself. There are no specific mentions of AI/ML model training, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, RAG, or traditional ML tasks. Therefore, the role is classified as a Software Engineer who is building software that happens to incorporate AI elements."

The responsibilities and what the candidate will NOT be doing further solidify the software engineering focus. The language is unambiguous."
