While AI tools and techniques are mentioned for automation and improving efficiency, the core responsibility is the configuration and integration of the CPQ system. The role does not involve developing or fine-tuning AI models themselves, nor does it focus on advanced GenAI concepts like RAG or prompt engineering. The primary output is a configured CPQ system, enhanced by AI, rather than an AI-native product. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the core responsibilities related to Salesforce CPQ configuration, which is a software development task. The mention of AI is in the context of enhancing these existing processes. The role is not focused on deep AI model development or specialization. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the description of 'AI tools and techniques' is somewhat general and could be interpreted with slightly more depth, though the primary focus remains on CPQ."
