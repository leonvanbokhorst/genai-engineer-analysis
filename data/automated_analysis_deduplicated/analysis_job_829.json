However, it's a junior to medior role, so the depth of involvement in specific AI tasks like fine-tuning or advanced RAG implementation isn't fully detailed. The mention of 'Machine Learning Models' alongside 'LLM' and 'GenAI' could imply a broader scope, but the explicit examples lean towards GenAI."
