        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on tasks related to training and evaluating generative AI models, specifically by providing feedback and answering computer science questions to improve their code generation. While it mentions 'software-engineer' in the initial question, the core responsibilities described (1.B.1: Model Development & Fine-Tuning) are predominantly in the AI Specialization category (Macro-Category B) and specifically related to Generative AI. There are no tasks related to traditional software engineering (Macro-Category A) like building applications, integration, or MLOps. Therefore, the 'GenAI Specialist' profile is the most appropriate fit."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the core tasks related to AI model training and evaluation, specifically for generative AI. However, it is light on specific technologies and the 'software-engineer' framing in the initial question could be slightly ambiguous if not for the detailed task descriptions. The tasks are clearly focused on the AI specialization rather than software engineering integration."
