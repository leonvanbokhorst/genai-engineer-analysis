While it mentions leveraging AI and integrating AI models, the core responsibilities and required skills are centered around building and maintaining the software application itself. There are no explicit tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG systems (Macro-Category B). Therefore, the role is classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, as it builds software that uses AI but does not specialize in the AI/ML aspects themselves."
