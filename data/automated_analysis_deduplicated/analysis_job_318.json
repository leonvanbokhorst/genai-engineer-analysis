        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on tasks related to training and evaluating generative AI models, specifically through creating and answering questions and ranking generated code. While it mentions 'software-engineer' in the introduction, the core responsibilities described fall under the 'GenAI Specialization' macro-category (Macro-Category B), with no explicit mention of traditional software development or integration tasks (Macro-Category A). The role is about directly interacting with and improving AI models, not building software around them. Therefore, 'GenAI Specialist' is the most fitting profile."
    },
    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines tasks related to training and evaluating generative AI models. However, it is quite brief and lacks specific details about the technologies or the broader software engineering context that might be involved. The mention of 'software-engineer' in the introduction could imply some integration tasks, but the detailed responsibilities lean heavily towards specialization. The confidence is high but not perfect due to the brevity and slight ambiguity regarding the extent of software engineering involvement."
