The core tasks described (developing frameworks, replicating scenarios, analyzing results with AI) fall under Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration) with a specific application of AI tools. While GenAI is mentioned, the primary focus is on its application within the software engineering process (QA automation) rather than core model development or GenAI specialization. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer role, where AI/ML is integrated into a software engineering function."
