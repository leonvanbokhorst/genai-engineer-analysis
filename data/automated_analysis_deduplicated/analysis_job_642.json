        "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on integrating AI capabilities into customer support systems and improving AI models based on human feedback. While there's mention of AI model fine-tuning and prototyping (1.B.1), the primary emphasis is on the application and integration of AI within a broader support system (1.A.1). The role is about enhancing an existing service with AI, rather than developing AI models from scratch or specializing purely in GenAI tasks. The soft skills also lean towards adaptability and self-sufficiency in a technical support context. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to AI integration and improvement within a customer support context. The tasks are specific enough to categorize, and the soft skills are also evident. However, it doesn't delve into the specifics of AI model architecture or deep generative AI techniques, making it lean more towards an adjacent role than a core AI engineering one. The confidence is high but not perfect due to the lack of explicit mention of specific AI/ML technologies or frameworks."
