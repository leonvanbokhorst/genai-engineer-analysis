While it mentions AI models and AI specialists, the core responsibility is integrating these AI components into existing .NET applications. There is no mention of developing AI models from scratch, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or specific GenAI frameworks. The role is about building software that *uses* AI, rather than being a deep AI specialist. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."
