        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on core software engineering tasks (1.A.1), such as building, scaling, and maintaining backend infrastructure, developing new features, and architecting services. While it mentions serving 'AI capabilities' and working with 'LLM providers', it does not detail specific Generative AI tasks like prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, or RAG implementation. The DevOps integration (1.A.2) is present but framed within the context of supporting the overall backend infrastructure. Therefore, the role is primarily a software engineering position that integrates AI/ML features into its product, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

    "confidence": {

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines core software engineering responsibilities and mentions AI capabilities as a context for the backend work. However, it lacks specific details on the nature of the AI work itself, making it slightly less definitive than a role explicitly detailing GenAI tasks. The classification leans towards AI-Adjacent due to the emphasis on backend infrastructure supporting AI, rather than direct AI model development."
