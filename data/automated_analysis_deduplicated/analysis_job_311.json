        "rationale": "The job description focuses exclusively on tasks related to training generative AI models by providing human feedback (generating questions, evaluating code). There are no tasks related to software development, integration, or operations (Macro-Category A). The core activities fall under Macro-Category B, specifically Data Engineering & Management (1.B.3), as they involve preparing and providing data for model training. Since the tasks are predominantly in Macro-Category B and specifically target generative AI training, the 'GenAI Specialist' profile is the most appropriate."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly defines the core responsibilities as providing human feedback for AI model training. While the title 'Big Data Engineer' might suggest a broader scope, the detailed tasks are specific to the training data aspect. The lack of mentioned technologies means that section is empty, but the core job function is well-understood. The confidence is high for task and profile classification."
