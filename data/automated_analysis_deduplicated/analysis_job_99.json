        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines both software engineering responsibilities and specific AI/ML tasks involving LLMs and vector databases. The 'AI focused projects' and explicit mention of 'AI/ML driven systems' and 'LLM's' make the AI component clear. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the 'understanding video' aspect could imply more traditional CV/ML, but the context with LLMs and vector databases leans towards GenAI applications."
