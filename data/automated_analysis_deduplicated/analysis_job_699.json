        "rationale": "The job advertisement focuses heavily on traditional software engineering tasks such as system configuration, maintenance, incident management, and the implementation of AI-driven systems to enhance operational efficiency. While AI tools are mentioned, the core responsibilities do not involve developing, fine-tuning, or specializing in AI/ML models themselves (Macro-Category B). The role is about using AI as a tool to improve existing software and operational processes, fitting the definition of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer or a Software Engineer. Given the lack of specific AI/ML model development tasks and the emphasis on network functions and operational support, it leans more towards a traditional Software Engineer role that leverages AI tools rather than a role focused on AI specialization. The tasks are predominantly from Macro-Category A."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the responsibilities, distinguishing what the role will and will not do. It emphasizes traditional engineering tasks augmented by AI tools, making the classification straightforward. However, it's not a perfect 5 because the exact nature of 'AI System Building' could be interpreted in multiple ways, though the context strongly suggests integration rather than core AI model development."
