        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on core software engineering tasks such as writing, deploying, and testing production-grade Python code, and integrating ML models into applications. While it mentions ML models, the emphasis is on the software engineering aspects of their integration and the surrounding development practices (code reviews, documentation, design reviews). There are no specific tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG, nor are there mentions of generative AI specific technologies. The tasks align predominantly with Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering), with soft skills related to collaboration. This profile fits 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' as it involves building software that uses ML models but doesn't focus on the AI/ML model development itself."
