        "rationale": "The job description heavily emphasizes traditional software engineering tasks related to designing, integrating, and refining AI tools within existing service frameworks. While AI is mentioned, the core responsibilities revolve around the development and integration of these tools into the customer service experience, rather than the deep development or specialization of AI models themselves. There is no mention of specific AI/ML model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. The focus is on the application and integration of AI tools, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities that lean towards software development and integration of AI tools, rather than AI model specialization. However, the term 'AI tools' is somewhat general, and the specific nature of the AI models or techniques used is not detailed. The role is described as 'Customer Support Engineer', which might imply a focus on support rather than core development, but the tasks listed are development-oriented. The confidence is high but not perfect due to the slight ambiguity in the depth of AI involvement and the job title."
