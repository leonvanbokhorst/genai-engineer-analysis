        "rationale": "The job description heavily emphasizes core software engineering tasks related to building and maintaining data pipelines, analytical software, CI/CD, containerization, and deployment. While it mentions supporting ML models and advanced analytics, the focus is on the engineering and operational aspects of these systems rather than the development or fine-tuning of the AI models themselves. There is no mention of Generative AI specific tasks like prompt engineering or LLM development. Therefore, the role is classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, as it involves building software that supports AI/ML functionalities but does not focus on the AI/ML specialization itself."
