While it mentions Generative AI (ChatGPT, Prompt Engineering, NLP) and its application in test design and frameworks, the core responsibilities and the overall role are centered around software quality assurance and development processes. The use of GenAI is presented as a tool to enhance these existing quality engineering tasks, rather than the primary focus of building or developing GenAI models themselves. Therefore, it fits the profile of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer who integrates AI/ML features into a product (in this case, testing tools and processes)."

The distinction between using AI for testing and building AI models is reasonably clear. The confidence is high, but not perfect, as the depth of GenAI involvement is described in terms of application to testing rather than core AI development."
