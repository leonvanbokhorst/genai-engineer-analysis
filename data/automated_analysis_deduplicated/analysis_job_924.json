        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on core data engineering tasks such as designing, building, and optimizing data pipelines, and maintaining production infrastructure (Macro-Category A). While it mentions collaboration with data scientists and the use of 'generative AI in risk summarization' as a product of the analytics team, the primary responsibilities and tasks described are foundational software engineering and data management. There is no indication that the role itself will be developing or fine-tuning GenAI models or directly engaging in prompt engineering. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer who builds and maintains systems that support AI/ML, rather than directly developing AI models."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines core data engineering responsibilities. The mention of 'generative AI' is in the context of the analytics team's products, not the direct responsibilities of the data engineer. This makes the classification relatively straightforward, but a slightly higher score could be achieved if the role's direct interaction with AI/ML models was more explicit."
