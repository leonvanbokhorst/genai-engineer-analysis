        "rationale": "The job advertisement is extremely brief and contains only a job title ('Data Engineer'), company name ('ML6'), location ('Amsterdam'), and sector ('Consultancy', 'Artificial Intelligence'). It does not provide any descriptive sentences or phrases detailing job responsibilities, tasks, technologies, or soft skills. According to the coding book, the 'Not Relevant' profile is assigned when there are 'No significant tasks from A or B'. As no tasks are described, this profile is the most appropriate classification."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is exceptionally sparse, providing only a title and basic company/event information without any details on responsibilities or required skills. This lack of information makes it impossible to perform a meaningful analysis or assign a profile with any degree of certainty."
