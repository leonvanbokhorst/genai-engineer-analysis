        "rationale": "The job description heavily emphasizes core software engineering tasks related to building and maintaining a machine learning platform (Macro-Category A: Software Development & Integration, Operations & MLOps). While it mentions collaborating with AI/ML researchers and enabling model-training experiments, it does not detail tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B: GenAI Specialization). The focus is on the engineering of the platform that supports AI/ML work, rather than the AI/ML work itself. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."
