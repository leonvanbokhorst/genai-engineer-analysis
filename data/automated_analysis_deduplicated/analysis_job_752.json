While GenAI is mentioned, the core focus is on the operationalization and engineering aspects of ML models rather than the development or specialization in GenAI techniques themselves. The role also involves creating reusable templates and collaborating on tech stack alignment, which are software engineering tasks. There is no explicit mention of deep generative model development, prompt engineering, or RAG. Therefore, it aligns best with a 'Core ML Engineer' profile that has a strong MLOps component and exposure to GenAI, but not a primary focus on GenAI specialization."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines MLOps responsibilities and mentions GenAI, but the overall emphasis is on the operationalization and engineering of ML models. The lack of specific GenAI development tasks (like prompt engineering or fine-tuning) makes the 'Core ML Engineer' profile the most fitting. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the mention of 'Gen AI' could imply a deeper involvement than what is explicitly detailed in the responsibilities."
