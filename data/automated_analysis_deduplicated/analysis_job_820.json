        "rationale": "The job advertisement focuses heavily on front-end software development tasks (building features, improving user flows, tracking, onboarding) which fall under Macro-Category A (1.A.1. Software Development & Integration). While it mentions 'Generative AI outputs' and the need to integrate with a Python backend, the core responsibilities and required skills are centered around the front-end application development itself, rather than the development or deep specialization of AI models. The role integrates AI outputs into the product but does not appear to be building or fine-tuning the AI models themselves. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

The role is clearly software engineering with an AI integration component, making the profile assignment straightforward. However, the depth of AI involvement is not detailed, preventing a perfect score."
