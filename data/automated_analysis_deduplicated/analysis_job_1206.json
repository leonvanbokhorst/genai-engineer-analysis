        "rationale": "The job ad emphasizes designing, developing, and optimizing data pipelines and integrating GenAI into analytics workflows, which are core software engineering tasks (Macro-Category A). While it mentions GenAI and ML models, the focus is on the engineering and integration aspects rather than deep model development or specialization in GenAI tasks like prompt engineering. The role supports the deployment of ML models and collaborates with data scientists, indicating that the primary output is software that leverages AI, rather than the AI models themselves being the sole focus. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

However, it lacks specific details on the exact nature of the GenAI integration or the depth of ML model involvement, which prevents a perfect score. The mention of 'advanced analytics' is also somewhat general."
