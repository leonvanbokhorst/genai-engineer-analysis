While there's mention of AI model fine-tuning, the core responsibility is integrating these AI capabilities into the support workflow and improving the overall system. The tasks lean heavily towards software development and integration (Macro-Category A) with AI as a component, rather than deep AI model development or specialization (Macro-Category B). Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

While it mentions 'AI model fine-tuning', the overall emphasis is on applying AI to solve business problems and improve existing systems, rather than core AI research or development. The distinction between AI-Adjacent Software Engineer and Core GenAI Engineer is clear based on the described tasks."
