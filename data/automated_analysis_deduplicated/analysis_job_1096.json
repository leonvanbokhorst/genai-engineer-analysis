Software Development & Integration` and `1.A.2. Operations & MLOps (LLMOps)`. While the role utilizes GenAI technologies (LLMs, GPT-4 Vision, CodeWhisperer), the focus is on building and integrating these into software systems (platforms, assistants) rather than on deep model development or research. This aligns with the definition of an `AI-Adjacent Software Engineer`, which is a software engineering role that builds or maintains software that directly uses or supports AI/ML as a core part of its functionality."
