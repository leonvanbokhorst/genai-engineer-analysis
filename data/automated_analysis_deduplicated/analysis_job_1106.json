        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the tasks and responsibilities, emphasizing traditional system support and configuration enhanced by AI tools rather than AI model development. The distinction between this role and a traditional engineering role is made, but the core tasks align well with Macro-Category A. There are no explicit mentions of AI/ML model development, fine-tuning, or advanced AI research, which solidifies the classification. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the phrasing 'AI System Building' could be interpreted slightly more broadly, though the context strongly suggests integration and management."
