        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on traditional software engineering tasks such as building modern web apps, enhancing cloud-native backends, and code reviews (Macro-Category A). While it mentions leveraging AI and generative AI for content generation and as a learning copilot, the core responsibilities and technologies listed are primarily software development focused. There's no indication of deep model development, fine-tuning, or advanced prompt engineering as the primary function. The role is about integrating AI into existing or new software products, rather than specializing in AI model creation itself. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering responsibilities and mentions AI integration. However, the specific tasks related to AI are described at a high level (e.g., 'leveraging AI', 'generative AI combined with comprehensive learning materials'). While the technologies are clear, the depth of AI involvement isn't as detailed as it could be for a more specialized AI role. The profile assignment is strong, but a slightly higher score would require more explicit detail on the AI tasks themselves."
