        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on traditional software engineering tasks such as translating business demands into solutions, implementation, and production within agile teams (Macro-Category A). While it mentions diverse data projects including NLP, time series modelling, and image recognition (which touch upon AI/ML concepts, fitting into Macro-Category B, specifically 1.B.3 Data Engineering & Management), the core responsibilities and the title 'Data Engineer' suggest the primary function is building and integrating data solutions rather than developing or fine-tuning AI models themselves. There is no mention of specific Generative AI tasks or models. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer role, where AI/ML concepts are part of the data engineering landscape but not the primary focus of model development."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is reasonably clear about the software engineering and data engineering aspects. However, it lacks specific details about the AI/ML technologies or models involved, making it slightly less definitive than a role explicitly focused on GenAI or core ML model development. The mention of NLP, time series, and image recognition is broad and could encompass various levels of AI involvement."
