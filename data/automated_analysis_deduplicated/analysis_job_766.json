Model Development & Fine-Tuning). While there's a mention of building and expanding team benchmark libraries (1.A.1. Software Development & Integration), the core emphasis is on the quantitative modeling aspect. The models described (economic capital, stress tests, valuation adjustments) are characteristic of traditional quantitative finance and machine learning, not Generative AI. This aligns with the 'ML Specialist (Data Scientist)' profile, which requires predominantly Macro-Category B tasks focused on traditional ML."
