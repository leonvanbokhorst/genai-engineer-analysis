The primary task identified (1.A.1) is software development and integration related to an AI platform. There is no mention of core AI model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or traditional ML tasks. Therefore, the role is classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, as it involves building or maintaining software (the platform) that directly uses or supports AI features."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is concise but clearly indicates a focus on platform engineering and implementation related to AI within the Azure ecosystem. While it mentions 'generative AI', it doesn't detail specific GenAI tasks. The confidence is high for the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile due to the emphasis on platform setup and implementation rather than core AI model work."
