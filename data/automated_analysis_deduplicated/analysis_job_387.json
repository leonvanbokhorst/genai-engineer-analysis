        "rationale": "The job ad primarily focuses on software engineering tasks (building scalable solutions, integration, development phases, improving infrastructure) which fall under Macro-Category A. While it mentions AI/model-based solutions and experimenting with new technologies, the core responsibilities are about integrating and developing these solutions within a broader software context, rather than deep specialization in model development or GenAI specifics. The emphasis is on building and integrating AI components into existing systems and applications, making it an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer role."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines a mix of business understanding, software development, integration, and some experimentation. The tasks are well-defined, and the technologies mentioned are standard. The primary focus leans heavily towards software engineering with AI integration, making the profile assignment straightforward. A slightly lower score is given because the ad doesn't explicitly mention Generative AI specific tasks like prompt engineering or RAG, but rather 'AI / model based solutions' which could encompass traditional ML as well. However, the integration and development aspects are very clear."
