It also highlights innovation, ownership, and collaboration, which are key for a core engineering role. While specific GenAI model development or prompt engineering tasks aren't detailed, the focus on GenAI strategy, solutions, and infrastructure, combined with core software engineering practices, points towards a 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile. The role requires a balanced mix of software engineering and AI specialization, with the AI specialization being specifically GenAI."
