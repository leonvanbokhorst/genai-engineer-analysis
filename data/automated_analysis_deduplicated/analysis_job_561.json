        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on traditional ML tasks such as 'statistical models', 'predictive algorithms', and 'uncovering hidden patterns'. While it mentions 'deep learning technologies' and 'generative AI', the core responsibilities described lean towards applying and operationalizing these models rather than specializing in the development or fine-tuning of generative models themselves. The emphasis on end-to-end solutions, operationalization, and generating business value from models, combined with the explicit mention of predictive algorithms, points towards a traditional ML Engineer role that might also touch upon generative AI concepts but isn't solely focused on them. There's no mention of specific GenAI frameworks like LangChain or prompt engineering, nor a deep dive into LLM architecture or fine-tuning. The tasks are balanced between model development (B) and software development/operationalization (A), but the *type* of models leans traditional ML."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to applying and operationalizing ML models, and mentions generative AI. However, the emphasis on 'statistical models' and 'predictive algorithms' suggests a stronger leaning towards traditional ML. The mention of generative AI is brief and framed as a question about safe and ethical deployment, rather than a core development task. This slight ambiguity in the depth of generative AI involvement prevents a perfect score, but the overall direction is clear."
