        "rationale": "The job advertisement only provides the title 'Medior Back End Engineer'. This title clearly indicates a role focused on traditional software development tasks (Macro-Category A) without any mention of AI or ML specializations (Macro-Category B), thus fitting the 'Software Engineer' profile."

        "score": 1,
        "reasoning": "The job advertisement is extremely brief, containing only a job title. This lack of detail prevents a comprehensive analysis of job tasks, technologies, and soft skills as defined in the coding book, making the analysis highly speculative beyond the general classification of the role based on the title."
