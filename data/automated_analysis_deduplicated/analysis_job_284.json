        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on traditional software engineering tasks such as designing, building, testing, deploying, and maintaining solutions ('Macro-Category A'). While it mentions 'GenAI solutions', the emphasis is on the engineering and delivery aspects rather than deep model development or specialization in GenAI techniques. The core responsibilities align with integrating and delivering AI-powered features into a product, making it an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer role."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering responsibilities and mentions GenAI as the domain of solutions. However, it lacks specific details about the depth of GenAI involvement (e.g., model training vs. integration) and doesn't mention any specific GenAI technologies or tools. This leaves a slight ambiguity regarding the exact nature of the 'GenAI solutions' part, preventing a perfect score."
