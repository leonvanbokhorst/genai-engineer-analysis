        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on developing and managing integrations between various systems, including AI/LLM, using tools like RPA and IPaaS. While AI/LLM is mentioned, the core tasks are about integrating existing systems and automating workflows, rather than developing or fine-tuning AI models themselves. The role involves advising on future developments and consulting with business partners, aligning with the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile which emphasizes software engineering tasks that integrate AI/ML features into a product or system."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is reasonably clear about the integration and automation aspects. However, the mention of 'AI/LLM' is quite broad and doesn't specify the nature of the AI work beyond integration. The primary focus remains on system integration and automation (RPA, IPaaS), making the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile the most fitting, but the exact depth of AI involvement is not fully detailed."
