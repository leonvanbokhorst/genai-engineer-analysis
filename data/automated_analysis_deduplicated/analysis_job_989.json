    "profile": {
        "assigned_profile": "ML Specialist (Data Scientist)",
        "rationale": "The job advertisement focuses exclusively on tasks related to training and evaluating AI models, specifically generative AI models. The core activities involve crafting data for training and evaluating model outputs ('Crafting and answering questions related to computer science in order to help train AI models', 'Evaluating and ranking code generated by AI models'). These tasks fall under Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization), specifically 'Model Development & Fine-Tuning' (1.B.1). There are no tasks mentioned that fall under Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering), such as software development, integration, or MLOps. Therefore, the role is predominantly focused on the AI specialization aspect, leading to the 'ML Specialist (Data Scientist)' profile, as the tasks are about model training and evaluation rather than building AI-integrated software products."
    },
    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the core tasks of training and evaluating AI models. However, it lacks detail on specific technologies or the depth of involvement in model development beyond data creation and evaluation. The absence of any software engineering tasks (Macro-Category A) strongly points to a specialist role, but the exact nature of the 'specialist' could be debated if there were more context. The profile assignment is confident based on the provided text."
