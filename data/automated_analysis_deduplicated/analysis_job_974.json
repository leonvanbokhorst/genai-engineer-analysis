        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on tasks related to training and evaluating AI models, specifically generative AI models. Phrases like 'help train AI models', 'train AI large language models', 'Crafting and answering questions related to computer science in order to help train AI models', and 'Evaluating and ranking code generated by AI models' all fall under Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization), specifically 'Model Development & Fine-Tuning'. There are no tasks mentioned that fall under Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering), such as software development, integration, or MLOps. While it mentions 'experienced software engineer', the core responsibilities are purely focused on the AI model training and evaluation aspect, making 'ML Specialist (Data Scientist)' the most fitting profile, with a strong emphasis on Generative AI tasks."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines tasks related to AI model training and evaluation. However, it lacks specific technical tools or detailed descriptions of the software engineering aspects that would be present in a more integrated role. The focus is squarely on the 'AI training' part, making the classification of the *tasks* straightforward, but the overall profile leans towards a specialist role due to the absence of software engineering responsibilities."
