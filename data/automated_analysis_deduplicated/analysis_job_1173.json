While it mentions 'data science and analytics', there are no specific tasks or technologies related to AI/ML model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). The role is about demonstrating and integrating a data platform, which is a software engineering function that leverages data capabilities, rather than developing AI/ML models themselves. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

However, it lacks specific details about AI/ML technologies or tasks, making it difficult to definitively classify it within AI/ML roles beyond its association with a 'Data Intelligence Platform'. The confidence is high for it being an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, but not a perfect 5 due to the absence of explicit AI/ML model development tasks."
