        "rationale": "The job advertisement focuses exclusively on tasks related to Generative AI specialization (Macro-Category B), specifically data preparation for training and model output evaluation. There are no tasks mentioned that fall under Core Software Engineering (Macro-Category A). Therefore, the role is classified as a GenAI Specialist."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines specific tasks related to AI model training and evaluation, making the classification of these tasks straightforward. The absence of core software engineering tasks also leads to a clear profile assignment. However, the ad is very brief and does not provide a comprehensive view of a broader software engineering role that might integrate AI, hence not a perfect score."
