        "rationale": "The job ad focuses exclusively on tasks related to training and evaluating AI models, specifically generative AI models. The core responsibilities involve crafting questions for training and evaluating AI-generated code. While it mentions 'software engineer' in the introductory sentence, the detailed tasks fall under the 'GenAI Specialization' macro-category (1.B.1 Model Development & Fine-Tuning). There are no tasks related to software development, integration, or MLOps (Macro-Category A). Therefore, the role is best classified as a specialist in AI model training and evaluation, aligning with 'ML Specialist (Data Scientist)' if we consider 'AI Training' as a specialized form of ML work, or potentially 'GenAI Specialist' if the focus was more on model architecture or fine-tuning beyond data interaction. Given the emphasis on data interaction for training and evaluation, 'ML Specialist (Data Scientist)' is the closest fit, interpreting 'ML' broadly to include AI training tasks."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the tasks related to AI model training and evaluation. However, it is light on specific technologies and the distinction between 'software engineer' in the intro and the specialist tasks could be clearer. The profile assignment is strong based on the described tasks, but the lack of technical specifics prevents a perfect score."
