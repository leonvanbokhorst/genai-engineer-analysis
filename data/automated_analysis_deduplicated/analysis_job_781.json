While it mentions integrating feedback and creating tools (1.A.1), the core emphasis is on the development and adaptation of generative AI models themselves, rather than integrating pre-existing AI into a larger software product. There's no mention of traditional ML tasks. The role requires collaboration and learning, but the primary technical focus is on GenAI model development and adaptation, fitting the 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile."

The mention of 'confidential computing' adds a specific domain but doesn't detract from the core AI focus. The tasks lean more towards model development than pure software integration. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the 'roadmap' and 'tools' aspects could be interpreted slightly differently, though the primary focus remains on GenAI model adaptation."
