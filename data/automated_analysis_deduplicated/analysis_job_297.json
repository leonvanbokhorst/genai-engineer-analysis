Phrases like 'help train AI models', 'train AI large language models', and 'Crafting and answering questions related to computer science in order to help train AI models' clearly fall under Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization), specifically 'Model Development & Fine-Tuning' (1.B.1). There are no tasks mentioned that fall under Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering), such as building applications, developing APIs, or managing MLOps pipelines. Therefore, the role is predominantly focused on the AI specialization aspect, leading to the 'ML Specialist (Data Scientist)' profile, with the understanding that the specialization is in Generative AI."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the core tasks involving training and evaluating AI models. However, it lacks specific details about the technologies used or the depth of the software engineering experience required beyond a general mention. The profile assignment is strong based on the task descriptions, but the lack of technical specifics prevents a perfect score."
