While it mentions AI integration, RAG, GPT-4, and ML algorithms, these are presented as features to be integrated into existing products rather than the primary focus of model development or deep AI research. The role is about building software that *uses* AI, not primarily about building the AI models themselves. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."
