        "rationale": "The job description focuses exclusively on core software engineering tasks (Macro-Category A), such as developing scalable backend systems, cloud platforms, and ensuring integration and testing. While the context is 'LLM mission-critical applications,' the role itself does not involve developing or fine-tuning AI models, prompt engineering, or RAG. Instead, it involves building the underlying platform that supports these LLM applications. This aligns with the definition of an 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer,' which involves building software that directly supports AI/ML models as a core part of its functionality."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job is clearly a software engineering role focused on building infrastructure. The AI aspect is in the domain the platform serves (LLM applications), implying direct support, which fits the 'AI-Adjacent' profile. However, the lack of specific AI tools or direct AI feature development tasks means it's not a 'Core GenAI' role. The confidence is high but not absolute due to the indirect nature of the AI involvement."
