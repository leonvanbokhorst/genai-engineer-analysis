        "rationale": "The job title 'Intern - Machine Learning Engineer (LLM)' strongly suggests a role that would involve both software engineering tasks (Macro-Category A) and specialized Generative AI tasks (Macro-Category B), with a focus on LLMs. This aligns with the definition of a Core GenAI Engineer. However, the advertisement lacks specific details about the actual responsibilities, making this assignment based primarily on the title."
