        "rationale": "The job advertisement focuses heavily on tasks related to training and evaluating AI models, specifically generative AI models that write code. Phrases like 'help train AI models', 'Crafting and answering questions related to computer science in order to help train AI models', and 'Evaluating and ranking code generated by AI models' clearly fall under Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization). There are no tasks mentioned that belong to Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering), such as building applications, developing APIs, or managing MLOps. Therefore, the role is predominantly focused on the AI specialization aspect, leading to the 'ML Specialist (Data Scientist)' profile, even though the models are generative."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the core tasks related to training and evaluating AI models. However, it lacks detail on specific technologies or the broader software engineering context, which prevents a perfect score. The profile assignment is strongly supported by the task descriptions."
