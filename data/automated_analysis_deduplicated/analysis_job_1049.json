        "rationale": "The job advertisement heavily emphasizes traditional software engineering tasks such as managing delivery, leading development and integration, collaborating with teams, and understanding software engineering principles. While it mentions GenAI components and concepts, the core focus remains on the software engineering aspects of delivery and integration. There are no specific tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. The role is about building and delivering software that *uses* GenAI, rather than specializing in the GenAI models themselves. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

The qualifications and responsibilities align well with the definition of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, making the classification straightforward."
