        "rationale": "The job advertisement focuses exclusively on tasks related to training and evaluating generative AI models (Macro-Category B), specifically in the context of AI model development and fine-tuning. There are no mentions of core software engineering tasks (Macro-Category A) like building applications, deploying services, or managing infrastructure. The role is about directly interacting with and improving AI models, not integrating them into software products. Therefore, 'GenAI Specialist' is the most appropriate profile."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is clear about the tasks involved in training and evaluating AI models. However, it lacks detail on specific technologies or the depth of interaction with the models, which prevents a perfect score. The absence of core software engineering tasks strongly supports the profile assignment."
