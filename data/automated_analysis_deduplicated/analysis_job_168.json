It also includes integration of these solutions into business processes (1.A.1) and collaboration to realize business value (1.C.1). The mention of exploring new AI technologies like Agentic AI, Conversational AI, and LLM Chains (1.B.1) further solidifies the GenAI focus. While there's a software integration aspect (1.A.1), the core of the role is clearly centered around GenAI model development and application. The soft skills mentioned, such as collaboration and inspiring stakeholders, are also present. Therefore, a balanced mix of GenAI specialization and software engineering tasks points to the 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile."

However, it lacks specific mentions of programming languages, MLOps tools, or specific GenAI frameworks, which would have made the classification even more definitive. The confidence is high but not perfect due to the absence of explicit technology mentions."
