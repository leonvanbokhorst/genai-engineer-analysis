While 'GenAI', 'data modelling', and 'data science' are mentioned, they are not the primary focus, and there are no specific tasks detailed for model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. The role is about integrating and automating processes, with AI/GenAI being a component rather than the core focus. The emphasis on being a 'trusted business partner' and driving the 'D&A strategy' further supports the integration aspect into existing business functions. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

The mention of GenAI, data modelling, and data science is present but less detailed, making it slightly less definitive than a role solely focused on AI model building. The overall emphasis leans towards automation and integration within a business context, allowing for a confident assignment to 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer'."
