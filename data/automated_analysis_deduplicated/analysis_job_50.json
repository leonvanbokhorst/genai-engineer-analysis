While there's mention of creating and supervising copy, which has elements of content development (1.A.1), the core focus and the unique skills highlighted are within the GenAI Specialization (1.B.2). There are no explicit tasks related to traditional ML model development or core software engineering beyond content creation. The role is about leveraging GenAI for content and client solutions, not building the underlying software infrastructure or traditional ML models. Therefore, 'GenAI Specialist' is the most fitting profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly focuses on prompt engineering and generative AI tools. However, it blends this with copywriting and marketing strategy, which are not explicitly defined as core software engineering or traditional ML tasks. The classification of copywriting as 1.A.1 is an interpretation based on its structured, strategic nature. The absence of specific technical tools or deep software engineering tasks makes it lean towards a specialist role rather than a core engineer. The confidence is high due to the clear emphasis on GenAI, but not perfect due to the unique blend with copywriting."
