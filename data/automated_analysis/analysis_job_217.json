Do you see yourself not just as a coder, but as a creator of AI-enhanced systems that outpace traditional methods? If so, you're in the right place.\n\n   While many software teams are stuck in the past with manual debugging and conventional deployments, Trilogy is leading the way with AI-integrated development. From feature brainstorming to bug squashing and performance tuning, AI is at the core of our process, making us efficient and precise.\n\n   In this role, you'll transform existing B2B products into cloud-native powerhouses, optimizing them with AI at every step. You'll be at the forefront of deploying AI-driven features, employing advanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for defect detection, and ensuring seamless releases without outages or disruptions. If you're after a role where action takes precedence over endless discussions, this is it.\n\n   Ready to redefine AI-driven software engineering and fast-track your career in high-scale cloud-native development? Apply now. But if you're content with the status quo, manual test cases, and teams hesitant about automation, this isn't your calling.\n\n   What you will be doing\n\n     * Utilizing advanced analysis tools and RAG vector stores to spot, diagnose, and resolve product flaws and bugs.\n     * Employing AI development agents to conceptualize, create, and deploy cutting-edge features for cloud-native apps.\n     * Partnering with an international team to deliver top-tier, enterprise-level solutions.\n\n   What you will NOT be doing\n\n     * Monotonous Repetition: We minimize routine infrastructure tasks, allowing you to focus on crafting groundbreaking solutions.\n     * Prolonged Meetings: We prioritize your coding expertise over lengthy discussions.

            "profile": "Ambiguous",
            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on software development using C# and mentions AI integration for enhancing existing products and workflows. However, it lacks specific details about building, training, or fine-tuning AI models, which are core to ML Engineer and GenAI Engineer roles. The emphasis is on using AI tools and RAG for tasks like defect detection and feature conceptualization within a software development context, rather than developing the AI models themselves. This aligns more with the 'Ambiguous' profile, which is for roles primarily focused on the *use* of AI tools to enhance productivity or traditional software engineering roles."
