        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on configuring and implementing Salesforce CPQ solutions, which falls under 'Software Development & Integration' (Macro-Category A). While it mentions applying 'AI tools and techniques to automate repetitive tasks,' this is in the context of enhancing existing software delivery and configuration processes, not developing or fine-tuning AI models themselves. The core responsibilities are centered around software configuration and customer requirements, with AI serving as a tool to improve these existing software engineering tasks. Therefore, the role is primarily a software engineering role that leverages AI, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."
