We're not just talking about code - we're talking about reshaping the future of education. Join our elite team and dive into a world where AI meets learning, creating products that are changing the game.\n\n   Picture this: You're bringing historical figures to life with TeachTap, crafting AI-generated educational content that captivates, building a Minecraft-inspired learning universe with TeachTower, and developing an AI learning copilot that integrates seamlessly with existing apps. This isn't your average dev job - this is where innovation meets purpose.\n\n   We're leveraging cutting-edge tech - Angular, React, React Native, AWS serverless, and the latest in generative AI. But we're not just using AI as a buzzword. We're on a thrilling journey to harness its full potential, freeing you from mundane tasks so you can focus on what truly matters: groundbreaking design, critical decision-making, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible.\n\n   Think you've got what it takes? Prove it. Take on our challenges: 15-min Cognitive, 90-min Coding, 180-min Technical Decision-Making. Excel, and you'll face a decisive interview with our Hiring Manager. More than half of those who make it this far walk away with an offer. Are you ready to unleash your potential and shape the future of learning? Your code could change lives. Apply now.\n\n   What you will be doing\n\n     * Architect and build state-of-the-art web applications using cutting-edge libraries and tools, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in educational technology.\n     * Design and implement robust, scalable cloud-native backends leveraging the latest serverless patterns on AWS, ensuring our innovative products can handle global demand.\n     * Lead code reviews to maintain the highest standards of code quality, ensuring our products not only meet but exceed customer expectations and industry best practices.\n\n   What you will NOT be doing\n\n     * Wasting your talents on trivial bug fixes or minor feature updates in legacy systems. We're focused on innovation, not maintenance.\n     * Wrestling with cumbersome infrastructure to keep poorly optimized products afloat. Our tech stack is cutting-edge, designed for efficiency and scalability.\n     * Getting bogged down in endless meetings about roadmaps and priorities. We value your time and skills - you'll be building, not just talking about building.\n     * Chasing colleagues for input or approvals. Our streamlined processes ensure you have the autonomy and resources you need to excel.",
