        "rationale": "The job ad primarily focuses on software engineering tasks (designing, developing, scaling platforms and services, code quality, collaboration) which fall under Macro-Category A. While it mentions leveraging AI models and algorithms to transform threat defense, the core responsibility is building the platform and integrating these AI capabilities, rather than deep model development or specialization in GenAI techniques like prompt engineering or RAG. The role is about building an AI-powered security platform, making it an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer role."

The mention of AI is present but not the sole focus, and specific GenAI techniques are not detailed. The profile assignment is strongly supported by the text, but a slightly higher score could be achieved with more explicit details on the AI models or techniques used."
