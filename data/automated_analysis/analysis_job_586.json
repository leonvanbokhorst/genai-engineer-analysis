            "profile": "Ambiguous",
            "rationale": "The job description focuses on security engineering and the application of AI/ML to enhance security operations. While it mentions AI models and algorithms, it does not detail the development, fine-tuning, or deployment of these models as core responsibilities. Instead, it emphasizes leveraging existing AI capabilities for security purposes and building security platforms. This aligns more with the use of AI tools to enhance productivity within a specific domain (cyber defense) rather than the core development of AI systems, making it fall under the 'Ambiguous' profile as per the coding book's definition."
