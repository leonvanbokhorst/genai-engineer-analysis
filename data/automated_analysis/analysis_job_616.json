While AI is central, the focus is on building and integrating these capabilities into a platform, rather than deep model development or specialized GenAI tasks like prompt engineering. The optimization of deployed AI capabilities also leans towards operational aspects of software. There is no mention of specific GenAI models or frameworks, nor traditional ML tasks. Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering responsibilities related to AI capabilities. However, it lacks specific details about the AI technologies or models used, which would have allowed for a more precise classification within the AI spectrum. The emphasis on platform building and integration is strong, leading to a high confidence in the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."
