            "rationale": "The job description focuses on traditional software engineering roles using .NET and JavaScript, with a mention of AI-related projects like 'robotic accounting', 'intelligent payment matching', and 'cash flow prediction'. However, it lacks specific details on developing, fine-tuning, or deploying generative AI models, RAG systems, or advanced prompt engineering, which are core to the GenAI Engineer profile. The emphasis is on enhancing an existing product with these functionalities rather than building AI-native applications. Therefore, it falls under the 'Ambiguous' category as it's not a clear AI-focused technical role as defined in the Coding Book."
