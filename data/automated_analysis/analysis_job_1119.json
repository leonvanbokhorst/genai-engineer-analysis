The mention of AI is in the context of tools used for these tasks, rather than the core development of AI models. The distinction between this role and a core AI/ML role is clear. The confidence is high, but not perfect, as the exact nature and depth of 'AI System Building' could be interpreted in slightly different ways without more specific details on the AI models or techniques involved."
