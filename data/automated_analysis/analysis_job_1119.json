While it involves AI, the core tasks are about application support, ticket analysis, and feedback for AI improvement, which aligns more with leveraging AI tools for productivity rather than core AI engineering roles like ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer. The emphasis is on 'Application Support' and 'AI-Augmented Customer Resolutions', indicating a user/support-centric role rather than a development-centric one."
