        "Functieomschrijving": "This is a new and structural position offered within the Department of Communication and Cognition at Tilburg University. It is funded by the Sectorplan Social Sciences and Humanities and partly associated with a recent NWO-KIC grant. The successful candidate will divide their time primarily between these two domains.\n\n   In the Department of Communication and Cognition, we increasingly rely on computational methods, for example, to collect and analyze data, but also to develop new digital applications which can be used for research purposes. The research software engineer will offer support to researchers, PhD candidates and (research master) students by developing, maintaining, and/or customizing new and existing tools for research purposes. Since this is a new function, we anticipate that the successful candidate will help set-up a digital support structure for the department, maintaining an overview of available tools, and offering small-scale programming support for individual researchers.\n\n   In the NWO-KIC project, we will develop a digital self-management platform that aims to help people with, for example, a history of depression to better monitor their own well-being, in order to prevent relapse. The platform to be developed will rest upon an existing experience sampling method (an app which asks participants repeatedly to briefly report on, for example, their thoughts, activities, and emotions on various moments during the day) and we will explore to what extent other sources of information can be integrated in this platform as well. The research software engineer will spend half of their time supporting the development and implementation of this platform.\n\n   In short, the main tasks of the successful candidate will be offering computational support to researchers with their research, helping to manage the computational research infrastructure of the department, offering support in the education of technical skills, such as programming or (automated) data collection and annotation, and collaborating with researchers within the NWO-KIC project for the technical development of a self-management platform for people with severe mental illness.",

While it mentions computational support, data collection, analysis, and programming, it lacks the specific focus on advanced AI/ML model development, fine-tuning, or deployment that would align with ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer profiles. The role appears to be more of a general research software engineer or computational support specialist within an academic setting, rather than a dedicated AI/ML practitioner."
