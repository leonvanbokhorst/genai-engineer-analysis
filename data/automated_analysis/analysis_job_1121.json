The core responsibilities revolve around analyzing tickets, providing feedback to AI, and integrating human expertise with AI, which aligns more with a user or enhancer of AI tools rather than a developer or engineer of AI systems. There is a lack of evidence for core tasks like algorithm development, data engineering, or building production-grade AI applications."
