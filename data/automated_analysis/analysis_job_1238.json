While LLM work is mentioned, it's in the context of embeddings, prompt engineering, and fine-tuning, which can be part of an ML Engineer's toolkit when applied to predictive tasks. The role also includes full project development cycles, model deployment, monitoring, and supporting infrastructure, all key aspects of an ML Engineer focused on productionizing models. The technologies listed, such as Python, GCP, Airflow, Docker, and Catboost, further support this classification."
