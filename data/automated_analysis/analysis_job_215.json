            "rationale": "The job description focuses on Salesforce CPQ configuration and leveraging AI tools for automation and efficiency within that context. While it mentions AI and transformation, it does not involve the core development, fine-tuning, or deployment of AI models themselves, nor does it focus on predictive modeling. The primary role appears to be a Salesforce consultant who uses AI tools, rather than an AI engineer building AI systems. Therefore, it falls under the 'Ambiguous' category as it primarily focuses on the use of AI tools to enhance productivity and is not a technical AI development role."
