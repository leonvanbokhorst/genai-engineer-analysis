While it mentions applying AI tools and techniques to automate tasks and improve delivery, the core responsibility remains within the software engineering domain of configuring an existing system. There is no indication of developing or fine-tuning AI models themselves (Macro-Category B). The role is about integrating AI into existing business processes via a specific software platform, making it an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer role."

The mention of AI is in the context of applying existing tools to improve these processes, rather than developing AI models. The profile assignment is strongly supported by the text, but a slightly lower score is given because 'AI tools and techniques' is a broad term and doesn't specify the depth of AI involvement beyond application."
