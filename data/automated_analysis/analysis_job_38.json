While it mentions Generative AI in the context of a blog post, the core responsibilities and tasks described align more closely with the 'ML Engineer' profile, specifically focusing on productionizing models and software development around them, rather than the core development or fine-tuning of generative models themselves, which is characteristic of a 'GenAI Engineer'."
