            "profile": "Ambiguous",
            "rationale": "The job description focuses on the use of automation tools like UiPath and mentions AI/ML and GenAI in the context of fixing existing robots and drafting process documents. It lacks the core responsibilities and evidence of building, training, or deploying predictive or generative models from scratch, or developing complex AI-driven applications. The primary focus is on monitoring and maintaining existing automation, which aligns more with business process automation than specialized AI engineering roles like ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer. Therefore, it falls under the 'Ambiguous' category as it's primarily focused on the use of AI tools to enhance productivity and business processes rather than core AI development."
