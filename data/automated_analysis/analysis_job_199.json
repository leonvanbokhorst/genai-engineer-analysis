It mentions specific AI technologies but the core responsibilities are framed around building and scaling systems. The profile assignment is straightforward based on the emphasis on development and integration rather than pure AI model creation. A slightly lower score is given because the ad is more marketing-oriented and less granular on the specific AI methodologies used beyond mentioning LLMs and specific tools."
