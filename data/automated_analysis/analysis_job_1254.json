It also emphasizes building 'end-to-end solutions' and 'robust solutions used in production' (1.A.1), indicating a blend of ML specialization and software engineering. While 'generative AI' is mentioned, it's in the context of safe and ethical deployment, not as the primary focus of model development or application. The role is about applying ML/AI to reveal patterns and generate business value, aligning with a Core ML Engineer profile rather than a GenAI-specific one."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the core tasks involving traditional ML and building production-ready solutions. The mention of generative AI is contextualized within ethical considerations rather than as a primary development focus. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the ad could have been more explicit about the specific types of models or the balance between traditional ML and GenAI if it were a mixed role."
