            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on traditional data engineering tasks such as building data pipelines, managing data infrastructure, and preparing data for analytics and reporting. While it mentions supporting ML & GenAI Ops, it does not indicate a primary focus on developing, fine-tuning, or deploying generative models or LLMs themselves. The core responsibilities and tasks described align more with a foundational data engineering role rather than a specialized ML or GenAI Engineer role. Therefore, it falls under the 'Ambiguous' category as it's not a clear fit for the specialized ML or GenAI profiles and is primarily a technical role focused on data infrastructure and pipelines."
