While it mentions setting up a Kubernetes environment for LLM models, the core responsibilities and the majority of the listed tasks fall under Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering). There are no explicit tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B: GenAI Specialization). Therefore, the role is classified as a Software Engineer."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines traditional software development tasks and mentions technologies. The mention of 'LLM models' in the context of Kubernetes setup is the only hint towards AI, but it's not a core responsibility. The structured list of tasks (B1-K1-W1 to W5) further solidifies the software engineering focus. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, due to the brief mention of LLM models which could imply a slight AI integration, though not detailed enough to shift the profile."
