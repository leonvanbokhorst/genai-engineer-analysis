There are no mentions of software development, integration, MLOps, or business strategy. The core activities described fall under Macro-Category B, specifically Model Development & Fine-Tuning (1.B.1). While the ad mentions 'generative artificial intelligence models', the tasks themselves are about the training and evaluation process rather than building applications with these models. Therefore, it aligns best with a specialist role focused on the model development aspect."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is clear about the core tasks involved in training and evaluating AI models. However, it lacks detail on specific technologies or the broader software engineering context, which prevents a perfect score. The profile assignment is strongly supported by the described tasks."
