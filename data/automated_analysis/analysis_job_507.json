While it mentions 'GenAI with LLM models' and 'ML solution architecture', the core responsibilities are centered around managing a software development team and the engineering process rather than deep specialization in model development or prompt engineering. The role is about building and managing the engineering aspects of an AI-powered framework, making it an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer role."

The mention of GenAI and ML is present but not detailed in terms of specific model development or advanced GenAI techniques. The profile assignment is strongly supported by the emphasis on team leadership and software development processes. A slightly lower score is given because the depth of ML/GenAI involvement is not fully specified beyond 'architecture design'."
