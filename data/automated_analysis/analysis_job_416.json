While it mentions 'play around with LLM' and 'stay updated with the latest advancements in AI', these are not the core responsibilities or a strong emphasis. The role does not detail specific generative AI tasks like fine-tuning, RAG, or agent development, nor does it require deep expertise in ML modeling or MLOps. The core responsibilities align more with traditional software engineering and backend development, making it fall under the 'Ambiguous' category as it's not a dedicated AI/ML role."
