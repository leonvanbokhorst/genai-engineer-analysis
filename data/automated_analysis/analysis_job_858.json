While it mentions 'data driven objectives' and 'data and analytics products', it lacks any specific mention of generative AI, large language models, diffusion models, or related technologies and tasks. The core responsibilities and technologies described align with a traditional IT operations or database administration role rather than an ML or GenAI engineering role. Therefore, it falls under the 'Ambiguous' category as it is not a technical AI role as defined in the coding book."
