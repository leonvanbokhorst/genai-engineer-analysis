It does not involve core AI/ML tasks such as model development, training, or deployment, nor does it heavily feature AI-specific technologies. The mention of 'Tridion Docs Genius' might suggest AI integration, but the core responsibilities and technologies listed are standard for frontend development, not AI engineering. Therefore, it falls under the 'Ambiguous' category as it's a traditional software engineering role."
