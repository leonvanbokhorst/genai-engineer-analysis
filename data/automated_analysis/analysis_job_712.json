While there's mention of AI model fine-tuning and improving AI systems (1.B.1), the primary emphasis is on integrating these AI capabilities into a customer support function and testing new AI tools (1.A.1). The role is not about developing AI models from scratch or deep specialization in generative AI techniques but rather about using and enhancing existing AI within a broader software/support context. The soft skills also point towards adaptability and self-driven problem-solving within a defined operational framework rather than deep AI research or development."

However, it lacks specific technical tool mentions, which would have provided more definitive classification. The profile assignment is based on the described tasks and the emphasis on integration and improvement rather than core AI model building or pure software engineering."
