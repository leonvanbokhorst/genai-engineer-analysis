The role requires a balanced mix of both software engineering and ML specialization, with a leaning towards traditional ML but an openness to GenAI."

However, the phrasing is somewhat broad in places, and the emphasis on LLMs is present but not as dominant as in a pure GenAI Specialist role. The classification leans towards 'Core ML Engineer' due to the explicit mention of R and standard ML pipelines, but the inclusion of LLMs makes it a balanced role."
