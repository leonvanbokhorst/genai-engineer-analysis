            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on leveraging existing AI tools to improve efficiency in software development tasks like coding, error detection, and feature development. It mentions 'AI-driven innovations' and 'AI-driven solutions' but does not detail the development, fine-tuning, or deployment of core AI models (LLMs, diffusion models, etc.). The emphasis is on using AI as a productivity enhancer within a traditional software engineering context, rather than building AI systems themselves. This aligns with the definition of the 'Ambiguous' profile, which includes roles primarily focused on the use of AI tools to enhance productivity or traditional software engineering without core AI model development."
