        "rationale": "The job title \"Technical Co-Founder (CTO & Developer)\" indicates a senior technical leadership role with hands-on development responsibilities. However, the advertisement provides no details regarding specific tasks or technologies. The `CODING_BOOK.md` profiles are determined by the distribution of tasks between Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering) and Macro-Category B (AI Specialization). Since no tasks are described, and crucially, no AI/ML technologies or methodologies are mentioned, the most reasonable inference is that the role focuses on core software engineering without AI/ML integration. Therefore, the `Software Engineer` profile, defined as tasks exclusively from Macro-Category A and no AI/ML involvement, is assigned. The \"CTO\" and \"Co-Founder\" aspects suggest strategic and leadership responsibilities, which align with `1.C.1. Business Understanding & Strategy` and `3.5. Innovation & Ownership`, but these do not alter the primary classification based on the A/B task distribution in the absence of AI/ML specifics."

        "reasoning": "The job advertisement is extremely sparse, containing only a title. This lack of detail prevents any meaningful analysis of job tasks, technologies, or soft skills. The profile assignment is a highly speculative inference based solely on the title, leading to very low confidence."
