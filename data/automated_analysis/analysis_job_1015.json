While it mentions 'prompt engineering' and 'AI technology trends', the primary responsibilities align with a customer-facing role that utilizes AI tools rather than building or engineering them. This fits the definition of 'Ambiguous' as it primarily focuses on the USE of AI tools to enhance productivity and customer adoption, rather than a technical engineering role."
