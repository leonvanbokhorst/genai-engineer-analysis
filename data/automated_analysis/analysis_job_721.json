While it mentions 'data science and analytics' and 'Spark programming', it lacks specific details about building, training, or deploying AI/ML models, fine-tuning generative models, or core MLOps practices. The role appears to be more focused on pre-sales technical consultation and solution design using existing platforms rather than core AI/ML engineering or GenAI development."
