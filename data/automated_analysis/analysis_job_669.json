While it mentions leveraging AI and generative AI for content generation and as a 'learning copilot', these appear to be features integrated into the software products rather than the primary focus of model development or deep AI specialization (Macro-Category B). The role is described as a 'Full Stack Engineer' who will 'deeply leverage AI', fitting the profile of a software engineer building AI-powered products."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines core software engineering responsibilities and mentions AI integration. However, the specific depth of AI involvement beyond integration and content generation is not extensively detailed, making it slightly less definitive than a role solely focused on AI model development. The mention of 'generative AI' in content generation is the strongest indicator of AI specialization, but it's framed within product development."
