        "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on integrating AI capabilities into customer resolution systems and improving existing AI models through feedback and fine-tuning (Macro-Category A tasks). While there are elements of AI model fine-tuning (Macro-Category B), the primary emphasis is on applying and improving AI within a broader application context rather than core AI model development or specialization. The role is about enhancing an existing system with AI, making it an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to AI integration and improvement within a support system. While it mentions 'AI model fine-tuning', the overall context leans towards applying and enhancing AI within an existing application rather than deep AI research or development. The profile assignment is reasonably clear, but the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile fits best due to the integration focus."
