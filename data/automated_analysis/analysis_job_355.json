The tasks fall predominantly under Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration) and Business Understanding & Strategy, with no specific tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer role, which builds or maintains software that uses AI as a core part of its functionality, and the output is an AI-powered feature or system, presented and sold to clients."

The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the specific technical implementation details of the AI within Service Cloud are not elaborated upon, leaving a slight ambiguity about the depth of technical AI involvement."
