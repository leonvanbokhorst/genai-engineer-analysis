        "rationale": "The job ad primarily focuses on traditional software engineering tasks such as developing, implementing, and maintaining Python applications, translating customer needs into functionality, and working with databases. While it mentions the integration of generative AI solutions and lists specific LLMs (OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic) as a plus, these AI-specific tasks are not the core focus. The role is about building software that *uses* AI, rather than specializing deeply in AI model development or GenAI-specific tasks like prompt engineering or RAG. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines core software engineering responsibilities and mentions AI/LLM integration as a secondary aspect or a 'plus'. The primary focus remains on software development. The profile assignment is straightforward based on this emphasis. A slightly lower score is given because the AI integration is mentioned as a growing area, and more detail on the *nature* of that integration could solidify the classification further, but the current description is sufficiently clear."
