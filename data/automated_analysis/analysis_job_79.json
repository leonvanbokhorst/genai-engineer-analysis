        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on traditional software development tasks (building products, prototypes, backend/API development, iterative improvement) which fall under Macro-Category A. While it mentions leveraging generative AI and conversational agents (Macro-Category B), the core responsibilities and emphasis are on integrating these technologies into a product rather than deep model development or specialization in GenAI techniques like prompt engineering or RAG. The role is primarily a software engineering position that uses AI as a component of the product, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software development responsibilities and mentions the use of generative AI. The distinction between core software engineering and AI specialization is evident, allowing for a confident profile assignment. However, it doesn't go into deep technical detail about the AI aspects, which prevents a perfect score."
