This team is working on a product that utilizes generative AI technology to support healthcare providers in their logistical processes.\n\n   Your main challenge is to collaborate with the team to translate these new technologies into a user-friendly and effective product. You will work together with our UX designer/researcher, front-end developer, and other team members to quickly develop prototypes. In doing so, you may need to be willing to accept less elegant or scalable solutions for rapid, testable delivery. Based on user testing, we then iteratively improve these prototypes. We are seeking someone with backend and API development experience who likes to go the extra mile. We are looking for curiosity, problem-solving skills, and the willingness to learn and implement new technologies.\n   Depending on your experience, a combination with a more leadership role within the new team is also a possibility.\n\n   Your team\n   Your team is a multidisciplinary product team within the Data Science group. The team consists of a UX designer/researcher and software developers with various specializations. You will be building a new product from scratch, where the team itself is responsible for using an iterative, exploratory process to discover how to leverage new technologies like generative AI and conversational agents to support healthcare workers with logistical challenges. In the long term, the experiences and insights gained from this product will form the foundation for the application of these advanced technologies across all of our products. You can also apply your knowledge more broadly within the Data Science group, allowing you to contribute not only to exploratory work but also to improving or expanding existing solutions.",
