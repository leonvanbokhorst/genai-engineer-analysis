While it involves AI, the core tasks are about application support, ticket analysis, and providing feedback for AI improvement, which aligns more with leveraging AI tools for productivity rather than core AI engineering roles like ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer. The emphasis is on 'AI-Augmented Customer Resolutions' and 'AI Training and Improvement' through feedback, not deep model development or complex software engineering around AI."
