While it mentions a 'DevOps mindset' and 'automation tooling', there is no mention of AI, machine learning, generative models, LLMs, or related technologies. The core responsibilities are centered around infrastructure reliability, scalability, and cost optimization, which are characteristic of a Systems Engineer or DevOps Engineer role, not an ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer. Therefore, it falls under the 'Ambiguous' category as it is not an AI-specific technical role."
