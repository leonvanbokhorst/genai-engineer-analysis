            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on Business Intelligence (BI) solutions, data products, and reporting, with a mention of 'GenAI reporting' and 'insights from GenAI data'. However, it lacks specific details about developing, fine-tuning, or deploying generative models themselves, or core ML engineering tasks like algorithm development, predictive modeling, or MLOps for ML models. The role appears to be more about leveraging existing GenAI capabilities for reporting and insights within a BI context, rather than building or engineering GenAI systems. Therefore, it falls under the 'Ambiguous' category as it's primarily a BI role that utilizes AI outputs rather than an AI engineering role."
