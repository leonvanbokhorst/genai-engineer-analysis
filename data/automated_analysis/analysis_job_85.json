There is no mention of Generative AI specific tasks like LLMs, RAG, or prompt engineering. The role is focused on the operationalization and engineering of ML systems, fitting the 'Core ML Engineer' profile due to the strong emphasis on MLOps and traditional ML tools, with a significant portion of tasks falling under Macro-Category A (MLOps/Software Development) and some under Macro-Category B (Model Development, though not explicitly GenAI)."

It explicitly details MLOps responsibilities and mentions traditional ML libraries, leaving little room for ambiguity regarding the role's focus. The absence of any Generative AI specific terms further solidifies the classification."
