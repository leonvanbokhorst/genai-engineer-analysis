While it mentions 'data scientists' and 'data science', the core focus on 'generative AI', 'innovative solutions', and developing 'functionalities' for platforms, coupled with the mention of 'AWS services', aligns more closely with the GenAI Engineer profile's responsibility of building and deploying generative AI applications. The role also includes aspects of software development and MLOps, which are key components of the GenAI Engineer profile."
