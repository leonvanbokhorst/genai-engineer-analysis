            "rationale": "The job description heavily emphasizes work with Large Language Models (LLMs), including foundational model training, web-scale data collection, efficient inference strategies, model alignment, and evaluation. It explicitly mentions 'crafting cutting-edge language generation technology' and 'expansive language models'. While it uses the title 'Machine Learning Engineer', the core responsibilities and technologies described align more closely with a GenAI Engineer who specializes in generative models and the applications built around them, rather than a general ML Engineer focused on predictive modeling. The tasks involve architecting distributed training infrastructure, innovating with deep learning for model quality, enriching training data, and optimizing training/inference, all within the context of LLMs."
