While it mentions supporting data scientists and enabling business users to build solutions, it lacks specific details about core AI/ML tasks like model development, training, fine-tuning, or deployment of generative models. The emphasis is on traditional full-stack development and enabling others, rather than hands-on AI/ML engineering."
