While it mentions 'data and AI development' and the 'Databricks Data Intelligence Platform powered by generative AI', the core responsibilities are about building and improving the software ecosystem for developers, rather than developing or fine-tuning AI models themselves (Macro-Category B tasks). The role is product management-oriented, strategizing and driving improvements in the developer platform, which uses AI as a foundational element of the product but doesn't require the PM to be an AI model builder. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile, where the primary focus is on software engineering and integration, with AI being a key component of the product being supported."

It explicitly mentions product management responsibilities. While it references AI and generative AI as part of the platform, the core tasks are centered around software engineering practices and product strategy for developers. The distinction between this role and a core AI/ML role is clear. A slightly lower score is given because the role is Product Management, not direct engineering, but the analysis of the *tasks* and *technologies* required for that PM role is well-defined within the coding book's framework."
