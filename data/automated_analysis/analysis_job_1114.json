While it involves AI, the core tasks are about application support, ticket analysis, and feedback for AI improvement, which aligns more with leveraging AI tools for productivity rather than core AI engineering roles like ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer. The emphasis on 'Application Support Engineer' and 'customer resolutions' points away from a deep technical AI development role."
