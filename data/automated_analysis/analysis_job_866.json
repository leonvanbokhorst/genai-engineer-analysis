        "rationale": "The role focuses on developing virtual assistants (AI task, 1.B.1) and integrating them into existing systems (Software Development, 1.A.1), using a specific platform (Copilot Studio, 2.4). While it involves AI development, the primary emphasis appears to be on building and integrating these assistants into broader banking functionalities, rather than deep model research or traditional ML. The 'guidance' aspect also suggests a role in applying existing AI capabilities within a software context. Therefore, it leans towards software engineering with AI integration."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is relatively clear about the core tasks of developing and integrating virtual assistants. The mention of 'Copilot Studio' provides a specific context. However, the depth of AI/ML involvement beyond using the platform and the specific nature of 'banking features' integration could be more detailed. The profile assignment is strong, but a bit more detail on the 'development' aspect of the virtual assistants could solidify it further."
