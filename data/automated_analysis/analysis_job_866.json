            "rationale": "The job description heavily emphasizes the application of Generative AI, specifically focusing on fine-tuning LLMs, integrating them into applications (like chatbots), and using AI for predictive analytics and personalization. The core responsibilities involve architecting and deploying AI products, transforming internal operations with AI, and leading AI integration initiatives. This aligns directly with the definition and core responsibilities of a GenAI Engineer, particularly the focus on LLMs, RAG (implied by chatbots), and building production-grade user-facing systems, rather than traditional ML model building for prediction alone."
