While it involves software development and operations, the core focus on generative AI applications (RAG) and advanced search techniques like semantic search aligns best with the GenAI Engineer profile. The mention of 'Machine Learning workflows' managed by a platform team also supports this, as GenAI engineers often leverage these for their models."
