It also includes tasks related to optimizing AI solutions within infrastructure (AWS) and architecting/deploying automated AI systems. This mix of direct GenAI model work (1.B.1, 2.3) and software engineering/operations for AI systems (1.A.1, 1.A.2) points towards a 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly lists specific GenAI tools and tasks related to their application and deployment. While it doesn't explicitly detail traditional ML tasks, the focus on 'AI-driven platforms' and 'autonomous AI systems' strongly suggests a GenAI focus. The 'Full-Stack Developer' title combined with these AI tasks solidifies the profile. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as there's no mention of specific programming languages or frameworks that would further anchor the 'full-stack' aspect."
