        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on research, development, and experimentation with Large Language Models (LLMs), including developing them from scratch and conducting cutting-edge research. While it mentions 'developers' and 'applied scientists', the core tasks described fall under Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization), specifically 'Model Development & Fine-Tuning' and 'Data Engineering & Management' related to responsible AI practices. There is no mention of traditional software engineering tasks (Macro-Category A) like integration into applications or MLOps. Therefore, the 'GenAI Specialist' profile is the most appropriate."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines a research-focused role centered on LLMs, their development, and responsible practices. However, it lacks specific details about the technologies or tools used, and the explicit software engineering (Macro-Category A) tasks are absent, which prevents a perfect score. The focus is clearly on the AI specialization aspect."
