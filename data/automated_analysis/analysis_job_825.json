While it mentions 'Generative AI outputs' and requires Python, the core responsibilities and technologies listed are primarily front-end development. There are no tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, as it builds software that integrates AI features but does not focus on the AI/ML specialization itself."

The mention of 'Generative AI outputs' is present but not the primary focus of the tasks. The role is clearly a software engineering position that interfaces with AI, rather than an AI specialist role. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the AI aspect is mentioned but not deeply detailed in terms of specific AI tasks."
