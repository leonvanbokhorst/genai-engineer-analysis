            "rationale": "The job description emphasizes leveraging open-source large language models (LLMs) for platform enhancement, which is a core responsibility of a GenAI Engineer. While 'Machine Learning Engineer' is in the title, the specific focus on LLMs, natural language processing, and the lifecycle management of models in production, including MLOps, aligns more closely with the GenAI Engineer profile. The mention of 'prototyping and development' on-premise and the 'growing MLops infrastructure' further support this, as GenAI Engineers often build and deploy generative models."
