        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on data engineering tasks (Macro-Category B, specifically 1.B.3 Data Engineering & Management) such as designing data architectures, building data pipelines, and managing data for LLM use cases. It also includes some software development/integration tasks (1.A.1) and operational tasks (1.A.2). However, the core responsibility is data management and pipeline creation to support AI applications, rather than developing or fine-tuning AI models themselves (Macro-Category B, 1.B.1) or building the AI features directly into a product (which would be more 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' if the focus was on the application layer). Given the strong emphasis on data infrastructure for AI, and the lack of direct AI model development, this role is best classified as supporting AI systems through data engineering. The mention of 'AI applications' and 'AI assistant' indicates integration of AI, but the primary tasks are data-centric. This leans towards AI-Adjacent Software Engineer because the output is software/infrastructure that enables AI, but the core AI model work is done by others (LLM engineers). If the role was purely about data analysis or traditional ML, it would be ML Specialist. If it involved building the AI features into the application, it would be AI-Adjacent Software Engineer. Since it's about the data *for* AI, and the role is 'Data Engineer', it fits best as a specialized data role supporting AI, making 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' the closest fit, as it's a software engineering role (data engineering) adjacent to AI development."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite specific about the tasks related to data pipelines, data architecture, and vector databases, which are clearly data engineering responsibilities supporting AI. The mention of 'LLM use cases' and 'AI assistant' provides context. However, the distinction between a pure 'Data Engineer' role supporting AI and an 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' can sometimes be nuanced. The profile assignment is strong, but a slightly higher confidence could be achieved with more explicit mention of the end-product or the specific AI models being worked with."
