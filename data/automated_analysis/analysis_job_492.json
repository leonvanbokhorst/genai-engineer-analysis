            "rationale": "The job description focuses on developing tools and infrastructure for privacy compliance automation, which involves software development and some data analysis related to privacy risks. However, it does not involve the core tasks of building, training, or fine-tuning predictive or generative AI models, nor does it heavily emphasize MLOps for AI systems. The role is more aligned with traditional software engineering applied to a specific domain (privacy) rather than a dedicated AI/ML engineering role. Therefore, it falls under the 'Ambiguous' category as it's primarily a software development role with a focus on compliance and automation, not a core AI/ML function."
