            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on customer success, service tools implementation, and operational improvements within a customer service context. While it mentions 'generative AI tooling (e.g. ChatGPT)' as a technology to innovate with, the core responsibilities and required experience are centered around customer service operations and tools (like Microsoft Dynamics, Zendesk, Salesforce) rather than the development, fine-tuning, or deployment of AI models themselves. The role is primarily about leveraging existing AI tools to enhance customer service, which aligns with the 'Ambiguous' profile's definition of focusing on the USE of AI tools to enhance productivity, rather than being a core AI development role."
