            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on customer success, implementation of customer service tools, and improving customer service operations. While it mentions 'generative AI tooling (e.g. ChatGPT)' as a way to innovate customer service processes, this is in the context of enhancing productivity and user experience within a customer service function, rather than core development or engineering of AI models. The primary responsibilities and required experience align with a customer-facing technical support or success role, not a specialized AI engineering position. Therefore, it falls under the 'Ambiguous' category as it's primarily business-focused and uses AI tools for productivity enhancement rather than being an AI development role."
