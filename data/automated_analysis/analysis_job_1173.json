            "rationale": "The job description focuses on a Solutions Engineer role, emphasizing client relationships, technical demonstrations, and pre-sales activities. While it mentions 'data science', 'analytics', and 'Spark programming', it lacks the specific details of model development, generative AI techniques, or deep MLOps required for ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer profiles. The role appears to be more focused on the application and integration of existing platforms rather than core AI/ML model building or deployment, aligning with the 'Ambiguous' profile for non-technical or primarily business-focused roles."
