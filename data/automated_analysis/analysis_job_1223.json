However, the role is an internship, which might imply a broader scope or less depth in specific AI/ML areas compared to a full-time role. The mention of 'AI and Machine learning, GenAI and Natural language processing' is a bit broad, but the core task of 'fixing issues in robots' and 'develop and deploy automations' anchors it more towards software engineering with AI integration."
