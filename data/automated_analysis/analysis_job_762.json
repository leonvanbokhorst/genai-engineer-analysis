            "rationale": "The job description focuses on pipeline engineering for rendering technology, involving creative tooling and artistic collaboration. While it mentions building, testing, and deploying changes, it lacks specific details about AI/ML models, generative techniques, or predictive tasks that would align it with ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer profiles. The emphasis is on traditional software development and infrastructure for creative workflows, making it fall under the 'Ambiguous' category as it's not primarily an AI-focused technical role."
