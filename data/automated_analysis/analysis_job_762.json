                "justification": "The title 'Python developer' implies traditional software development tasks. The mention of 'LLM experience' suggests the integration of LLM capabilities into software applications, fitting the definition of building or maintaining software that uses AI/ML features as a core part of its functionality."

        "rationale": "The job title and description clearly indicate a software development role ('Python developer'). The mention of 'LLM experience' signifies that AI/ML features (specifically generative AI) will be integrated into the software product. However, the advertisement lacks any specific details about generative AI tasks (like model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, RAG) or related technologies, suggesting the primary focus remains on software engineering with an AI component, rather than deep AI specialization."

        "score": 2,
        "reasoning": "The job advertisement is extremely brief and lacks specific details about the responsibilities, required skills beyond 'Python' and 'LLM experience,' or the nature of the LLM integration. This makes it difficult to confidently assign categories and a profile with high certainty. The analysis relies heavily on inferring the role from the title."
