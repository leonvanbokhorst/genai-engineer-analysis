            "rationale": "The job description focuses on developing scripts to automate tasks for software developers and creating a proof of concept for an on-premise LLM for document Q&A. While it mentions LLMs, the core tasks described lean towards scripting, automation, and proof-of-concept development rather than building production-grade generative AI applications or traditional ML models. The role is also framed as an internship with a focus on supporting daily work and gaining experience, which doesn't align with the core responsibilities of an ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer. The description lacks the depth and specific technical requirements typically associated with those specialized roles."
