Trilogy is on the lookout for exceptional engineers to lead the charge in adopting generative AI tools both in our development process and into our products.\n\n   Join us to work on our exciting product portfolio:\n     * TeachTap: Bringing historical figures to life using AI, offering an engaging, TikTok-like learning experience to make learning more relevant and fun.\n     * Educational Content Generation: Utilizing the latest in generative AI combined with comprehensive learning materials to create captivating content.\n     * TeachTower: A game-based motivation system inspired by popular games like Roblox and Minecraft, designed to make learning irresistibly fun.\n     * Coachbot: A learning copilot that integrates with existing apps, guiding learning paths, recommending next steps, and rewarding daily progress.\n\n   Your role will focus on integrating AI into engineering practices, using AI tools to increase efficiency and solve engineering tasks like coding and testing. Based on the obtained results, you will derive recipes and playbooks to be adopted by the broader engineering team. Maintaining high-quality standards in our codebases while ensuring high leverage of AI tools across our engineering teams will be a key part of your work.\n\n   You will be an integral part of our existing engineering team, working collaboratively on our suite of products to deeply understand our environment and needs. You will have the freedom to propose and experiment with new tools and then will leverage the insights and experiences obtained to evolve our processes, advocate for new tool adoption, or even spearhead the creation of small tools, bots, and frameworks to enhance our technical setup.\n\n   We seek candidates with a strong background in software engineering and a capacity for adapting to new technologies. Moreover, an interest in the latest generative AI developments and a drive for innovation are crucial. While our primary tech stack is AWS Serverless with TypeScript, we're looking for versatile engineers who can excel in a variety of technical environments and challenges.\n\n   What you will be doing\n\n     * Developing fully functional features, using AI tools to expedite delivery and enhance quality.\n     * Performing experiments with AI to enhance engineering processes, including decomposition, solution design, code generation, and troubleshooting.\n     * Documenting best practices and techniques in guides that enable others to harness the power of generative AI effectively.\n\n   What you will NOT be doing\n\n     * Building new AI models from scratch; instead, your focus will be on leveraging and fine-tuning existing models to maximize efficiency.\n     * Being confined to outdated technologies; we encourage an environment that thrives on dynamic tech stacks, fostering continuous innovation., * Drive transformative change by establishing a framework that seamlessly integrates generative AI, significantly amplifying engineering productivity.",

Key responsibilities include developing features using AI tools, experimenting with AI for engineering processes (coding, testing), and creating documentation and playbooks for AI adoption. The projects described, such as TeachTap (bringing historical figures to life with AI) and Coachbot (a learning copilot), are direct applications of generative AI. While strong software engineering skills are required, the core focus is on applying and building around GenAI technologies, aligning with the definition of a GenAI Engineer."
