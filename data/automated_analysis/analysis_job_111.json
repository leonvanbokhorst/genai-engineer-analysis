            "rationale": "The job description focuses on a Senior Front-End Engineer role, emphasizing the development of user-facing interfaces for a conversational search product. While it mentions the use of generative AI and LLMs as underlying technologies, the core responsibilities and required skills are centered around front-end development, not the design, training, or deep integration of AI models themselves. The role is primarily about building the user experience around AI, rather than building the AI systems. Therefore, it does not fit the core definitions of ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer, which require a deeper focus on model development, MLOps, or AI system architecture."
