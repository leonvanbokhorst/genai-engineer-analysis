            "rationale": "The job description focuses on a Senior Front-End Engineer role, emphasizing the development of user interfaces for a conversational search product that leverages generative AI. However, the core responsibilities and required skills are primarily centered around front-end development, not the core engineering of AI models or complex AI systems. While the product uses AI, the role itself is not an AI engineering role as defined by the coding book. It lacks the depth in data engineering, modeling, or MLOps that would classify it as an ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer."
