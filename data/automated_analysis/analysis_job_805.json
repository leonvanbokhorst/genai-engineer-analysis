While it mentions working with 'cutting-edge technology' and solving the 'data privacy dilemma', it does not describe any core responsibilities related to developing, training, fine-tuning, or deploying AI models, nor does it involve deep technical work in data engineering, modeling, software development, or MLOps. The primary focus is on business development and sales, making it a non-technical role or a role that primarily uses AI tools for productivity rather than building them."
