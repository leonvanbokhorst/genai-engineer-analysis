This aligns strongly with the core responsibilities of a GenAI Engineer, particularly in building and maintaining production-grade user-facing software systems and leveraging generative models and frameworks. While there's mention of machine learning capabilities, the focus on agents and platform-level AI solutions points more towards GenAI than traditional ML Engineering."
