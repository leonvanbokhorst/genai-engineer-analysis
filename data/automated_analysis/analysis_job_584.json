            "rationale": "The job description emphasizes developing and operating security services and frameworks, architecting and scaling security solutions, and a strong focus on ML/GenAI for threat detection. While it mentions user-facing products, the core responsibility is security services and threat analysis using ML, aligning with the ML Engineer profile's focus on data-driven algorithms for prediction and anomaly detection, and productionizing systems. The mention of 'extensive heterogeneous data' and 'ML/GenAI backed' points towards data-driven modeling for security threats, which is a key aspect of ML Engineering."
