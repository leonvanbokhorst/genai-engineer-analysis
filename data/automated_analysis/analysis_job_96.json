While it mentions generative AI, the core tasks are about implementation, management, and improvement of existing systems. The distinction between this role and a core AI/ML role is clear, leading to a high confidence in the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile. The mention of specific CRM and customer service tools further solidifies this classification."
