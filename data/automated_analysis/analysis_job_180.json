While it mentions 'AI-based enterprise applications', it lacks specific details about generative models, LLMs, or core ML model development that would align it with ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer profiles. The emphasis is more on application development, customer interaction, and platform utilization rather than core AI/ML research or engineering."
