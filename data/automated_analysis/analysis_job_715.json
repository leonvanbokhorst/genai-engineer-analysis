While it mentions exploring Neuro Symbolic AI and interfacing with an LLM, these are presented as exploratory or future additions to an existing software product rather than the primary focus of the role. The core responsibilities are firmly rooted in Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration), with a minor element from Macro-Category B (AI Specialization). This aligns with the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

The AI/LLM aspect is mentioned but seems to be an area of exploration rather than the primary focus. The distinction between core development and AI integration is reasonably clear, leading to a high confidence score. A score of 5 might be reserved for roles where the AI/ML component is more deeply integrated into the day-to-day tasks."
