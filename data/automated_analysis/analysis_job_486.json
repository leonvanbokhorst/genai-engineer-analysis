        "rationale": "The job title 'Software Engineer - Cyber Defense' indicates a role focused on software development within the cybersecurity domain. There is no mention of AI/ML tasks or technologies, suggesting the role primarily involves traditional software engineering (Macro-Category A) without AI/ML integration, aligning with the 'Software Engineer' profile."

        "score": 1,
        "reasoning": "The job advertisement provided is only a title ('Software Engineer - Cyber Defense') and contains no descriptive text about responsibilities, tasks, or technologies. Therefore, a detailed analysis based on the CODING_BOOK.md is not possible, and the assigned profile is a strong inference based solely on the job title."
