            "rationale": "The job description mentions AI Engineer and discusses AI-driven platform capabilities, machine learning models, and fine-tuning LLMs. However, it lacks specific details about the core responsibilities and technologies typically associated with either an ML Engineer or a GenAI Engineer. The focus is more on the application of AI within a banking platform rather than deep specialization in building or fine-tuning models themselves. The description is also heavily weighted towards soft skills and company culture, with limited technical depth to definitively classify it as a specialized AI engineering role."
