            "rationale": "The job description focuses on a Solutions Engineer role, emphasizing customer relationships, technical advisement on architecture and design, and demonstrating a platform's value. While it mentions 'data science' and 'analytics', it lacks specific details about building, training, or deploying AI/ML models, fine-tuning LLMs, or developing generative AI applications. The core responsibilities lean towards pre-sales technical support and customer engagement rather than hands-on AI/ML engineering or development. Therefore, it does not fit the criteria for ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer and is best classified as Ambiguous."
