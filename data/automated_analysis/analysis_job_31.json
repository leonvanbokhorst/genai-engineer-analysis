The profile assignment is straightforward based on the explicit mentions of GenAI algorithms and use cases alongside software engineering practices. A slightly lower score is given because the ad doesn't explicitly mention LLM frameworks or prompt engineering, but the overall description strongly suggests a GenAI focus."
