            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on customer engagement, technical advisory, and pre-sales activities, rather than the core development, implementation, or MLOps of AI/ML models. While it mentions 'data science and analytics' and 'Spark programming', it lacks specific details about building, training, or deploying generative AI models or predictive systems, which are central to ML Engineer and GenAI Engineer roles. The role appears to be more of a pre-sales technical consultant or solutions architect, aligning with the 'Ambiguous' profile as it's not a core AI/ML development role."
