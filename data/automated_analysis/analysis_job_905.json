You'll get your foot in the door with one of the most prominent players in the AI/LLM space today. We seek software engineers with 3+ years of experience to train large AI language models, helping cutting-edge generative AI models write better code. Projects typically include discrete, highly variable problems that involve engaging with these models as they learn to code. We currently have 200+ roles open!, * If you seem like a good fit, we'll send an async RLHF code review that will take 35 minutes and must be finished within 72 hours of us sending it.\n     * You'll receive credentials to the RLHF platform. We'll then set up a group call to answer any further questions about onboarding with the company.\n     * You'll perform a simulated production-level task (RLHF task) on the platform. This will be your final interview, which will ultimately determine your employment and leveling. Successful completion of this process provides you with an opportunity to work on projects as they become available.",
