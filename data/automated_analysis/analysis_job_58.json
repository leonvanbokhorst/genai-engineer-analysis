            "rationale": "The job description focuses on web and app development with AI integration, but lacks specific details on core AI engineering tasks like model development, fine-tuning, or deep generative model work. It emphasizes collaboration, deployment, and maintenance of AI-centric solutions within web/mobile applications, which could fall under traditional software development roles that leverage AI tools rather than specializing in AI model creation or advanced generative AI engineering. The title 'Senior Web Developer/Senior App Developer' further reinforces this focus. The role appears to be more about integrating AI into existing application development paradigms rather than being a dedicated AI engineering role."
