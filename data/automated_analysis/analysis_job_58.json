            "rationale": "The job description focuses on web and app development with AI integration, but lacks specific details on core AI engineering tasks like model development, fine-tuning, or deep generative model work. The emphasis on 'AI-centric solutions' and 'AI-driven Web / Mobile Applications' suggests a role that utilizes AI rather than building foundational AI models. The responsibilities lean more towards traditional software development and system maintenance with an AI component, rather than specializing in AI model engineering or generative AI development. Therefore, it does not strongly align with ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer profiles and is best classified as Ambiguous."
