            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on leadership, client advisory, business development, and architectural strategy across various software engineering domains, including data and genAI. However, it explicitly states 'not expected to be a hands on developer at this stage of the career' and lacks specific details on core ML/GenAI engineering tasks like model training, fine-tuning, or deep RAG implementation. While genAI is mentioned as a domain to advise on, the primary focus is on broader software engineering leadership and strategy, making it fall under the 'Ambiguous' profile as it's not a dedicated technical AI engineering role."
