While AI is mentioned, the core responsibilities are rooted in traditional BI development and client consultation, with AI serving as an accelerator rather than the central focus of model building or specialization. There are no explicit tasks related to core ML model development or GenAI specialization (like LLMs, RAG, prompt engineering)."

The classification is straightforward based on the provided coding book, though the 'AI' aspect is general rather than specific to GenAI or traditional ML models."
