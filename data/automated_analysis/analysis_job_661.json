            "rationale": "The job description focuses on designing and refining AI tools to enhance customer service, predict client needs, and automate responses. While it mentions AI technologies, it lacks the depth in core AI/ML engineering tasks like algorithm development, model training, or productionizing complex generative models. The emphasis is on integrating and utilizing AI tools for customer support, rather than building foundational AI systems. The responsibilities lean towards application and education of AI tools within a customer service context, aligning more with the 'use of AI tools to enhance productivity' aspect of the Ambiguous profile, rather than a specialized ML or GenAI Engineer role."
