While it involves collaboration with LLM engineers and working with LLMs and vector databases, the core responsibilities do not align with the definition of a GenAI Engineer, which focuses on designing, developing, fine-tuning, and deploying applications built on generative models themselves. Instead, this role supports those efforts by managing the data infrastructure."
