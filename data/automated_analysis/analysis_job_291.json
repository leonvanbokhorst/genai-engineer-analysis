Key responsibilities include evaluating, building, and applying tools, developing tooling prototypes, and influencing product roadmaps, aligning with the GenAI Engineer profile's focus on developing and deploying applications built on generative models. While there's mention of data modeling and application code conversion, the core theme revolves around leveraging GenAI for transformation and feedback to R&D, rather than traditional predictive modeling or pure software development."
