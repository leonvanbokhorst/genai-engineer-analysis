It also emphasizes optimizing internal tools and infrastructure, and collaborating with teams to align solutions with business goals. While 'GenAI' is mentioned as an area to explore, the core responsibilities lean towards traditional ML tasks like 'predictive models' and 'data analysis'. The role requires a balance of software engineering (designing, developing, implementing, optimizing tools/infrastructure) and AI specialization (developing ML/GenAI ideas, analyzing datasets). Given the explicit mention of 'predictive models' and the general nature of 'AI and machine learning solutions' without a strong focus on generative-specific tasks like prompt engineering or RAG, it fits the 'Core ML Engineer' profile best, as it requires both software engineering and traditional ML expertise."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad provides a good overview of responsibilities and tasks. It clearly indicates a blend of software engineering and AI/ML work. However, the mention of 'GenAI' alongside 'predictive models' and 'data analysis tools' could be interpreted in slightly different ways regarding the primary focus. The confidence is high but not perfect due to this slight ambiguity in the emphasis between traditional ML and GenAI."
