        "Functieomschrijving": "As a Senior Software Developer at Elanza, you will play a crucial role in enhancing collaborations across the entire healthcare chain. A key aspect of this is system integration. Our application integrates with client and supplier systems, automating a significant portion of manual administrative processes. We connect with planning and HR systems, electronic client records (ECD), systems of external staffing suppliers, and Identity & Access Management (IAM) packages.\n\n   Another way to enhance collaboration is through data-driven insights. Using algorithms, we can automatically identify the most suitable healthcare provider, saving repetitive work and enabling organizations to make better decisions and optimize processes., You will primarily work on the backend of the application. During the initial months, your focus will be on restructuring the architecture and domain model, where events will play a central role. Afterward, the focus will shift to the outer layers of the application, which includes handling complex integrations with new external systems such as planning, HR, and financial tools, as well as enhancing the interface with the internal GraphQL API.\n\n   Development Process\n\n   We follow agile/scrum methodologies in a pragmatic and lightweight manner. We review each other's pull requests and occasionally collaborate in pair-programming sessions. Our build pipelines with unit tests run automatically, allowing us to release multiple times a day through CI/CD.\n\n   Tech Stack\n\n   Our modern stack includes TypeScript for both backend and frontend, along with Node.js, React.js, GraphQL, PostgreSQL, all running on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).\n\n   Personal Development\n\n   We value lifelong learning. While most learning occurs on the job, you can dedicate 10% of your time to side projects focused on innovation and personal growth. Additionally, you'll mentor team members to become better developers.",
