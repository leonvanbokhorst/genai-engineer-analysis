This aligns directly with the core responsibilities and evidence profile of a GenAI Engineer, particularly in the use of generative models and building AI-powered solutions. While it mentions AWS (Cloud Platforms), the primary focus is on the application and integration of generative AI technologies rather than general ML model development or data engineering."
