It emphasizes traditional software engineering tasks like back-end development, code reviews, and integrating AI-driven solutions, but lacks specific details on building, fine-tuning, or deploying generative models or advanced AI systems. The role appears to be more about using AI as a productivity enhancer within a software engineering context, aligning with the definition of the 'Ambiguous' profile."
