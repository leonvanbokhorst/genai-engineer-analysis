While AI tools are mentioned as a means to enhance these processes, the core responsibilities do not involve developing or fine-tuning AI models themselves (Macro-Category B). The role is about applying AI to improve existing operational and support functions, making it an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer role."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the tasks involved, which are predominantly software engineering and operational support, enhanced by AI tools. It explicitly states it's not a traditional engineering or support role but combines technical work with AI. The lack of specific AI model development tasks (like training, fine-tuning, prompt engineering) makes the classification straightforward. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the description of 'AI System Building' could be interpreted slightly more broadly, though the context strongly suggests integration rather than core AI development."
