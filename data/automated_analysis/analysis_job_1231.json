While the role involves piloting emerging technologies like GenAI and ML and participating in related communities, the core responsibilities are platform-centric rather than directly developing AI models or features. The cloud platform is described as an enabler for digital transformation and specifically for piloting GenAI and ML, meaning the software built directly supports AI/ML models as a core part of its functionality. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile, which involves building software that supports AI/ML, with tasks predominantly from Macro-Category A."
