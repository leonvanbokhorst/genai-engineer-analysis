            "rationale": "The job description focuses on IT Operations and IT Support, with a strong emphasis on bridging the gap between IT Support and DevOps. While it mentions working with DevOps engineers and improving/automating processes, it does not describe core AI/ML engineering tasks such as developing, training, fine-tuning, or deploying AI models. The role appears to be a traditional IT Operations Engineer role, which falls outside the scope of ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer profiles. Therefore, the 'Ambiguous' classification is most appropriate as it is not a technical AI role as defined in the coding book."
