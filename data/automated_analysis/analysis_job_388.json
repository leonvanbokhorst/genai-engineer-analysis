While AI/model-based solutions are mentioned, the core responsibilities are focused on the engineering and integration aspects rather than deep model development or specialization in Generative AI. The tasks primarily fall under Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering), with a clear focus on integrating AI components into a broader application context."

It's not a pure software engineering role, but the emphasis is on building and integrating rather than deep AI research or model creation. The profile assignment is straightforward based on the task distribution. A slightly lower score is given because the term 'AI' is used broadly, and it's not explicitly stated if the focus is on traditional ML or GenAI, though the tasks lean towards integration."
