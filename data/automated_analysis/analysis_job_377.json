It also includes integrating AI solutions into a product suite (1.A.1) and enhancing system performance and scalability (1.A.2), which are core software engineering tasks (Macro-Category A). The presence of tasks from both macro-categories indicates a balanced role, and the absence of specific Generative AI technologies (like LLMs, RAG) points towards a focus on traditional ML, making \"Core ML Engineer\" the most fitting profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is clear about the core responsibilities of an ML Engineer, covering model development, integration, and optimization. However, the initial mention of \"(gen)AI\" without further specification of generative models introduces a slight ambiguity regarding the precise focus, though the bulk of the description points to traditional ML."
