And develop new features using the latest technology.\n\n   You participate in standups and refinements, develop code, enforce code quality, develop best practices, write tests and manage the continuous integration of code. More specifically, as Medior Devops Engineer you: \n     * Develop a feature-rich product for our employees, guided by a senior developer.  \n\n     * Understand how to technically scale the services in the 'employee experience platform', which empowers the \"@AH app\". \n\n     * Understand how to combine best agile development practices in combination with a services-based architecture. \n\n     * Are knowledgeable of your domain (Kotlin back-end services on our Azure Kubernetes platform), though you can also liaise with other engineers and their respective technologies (Front and Back End). \n\n   Why we believe this is a cool job \n     * You get to work with modern technologies, and since this is a new-build solution, we have zero legacy.\n\n     * Opportunity to learn more about test automation, IT security. As long as you have a solid background as a backend developer (Kotlin).\n\n     * Everything we build in the app is scalable, using Azure and Microservices, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines. We work in small increments so we're able to put things live straight away, hence reduce our time to market.  \n\n     * We work in a multi-disciplinarian team; with dedicated QA, UX designer, developers, product owner. In total the team consists of 8+ people.\n\n     * This initiative, building an employee app for your own colleagues, is a priority project for Albert Heijn, with the potential of scaling to other brands within Ahold Delhaize. \n\n   What do you bring \n\n   At AH Technology you will be working for one of the biggest food retailers in the Netherlands. To be successful as our new medior back end engineer you bring: \n     * A Technology/IT Engineering bachelor's or master's degree, or equivalent work experience;  \n\n     * You know your technology stack: you have experience with Kotlin and some experience with MongoDB, Azure, Docker, k8s and / or Kafka.\n\n     * Know your way around with CI/CD, including test automation integrations and release engineering automation (fyi, we use Azure DevOps and Github Actions)",

While it mentions modern technologies and a new-build solution, there is no indication of Generative AI, LLMs, diffusion models, or any related advanced AI/ML modeling techniques. The role is primarily about building and maintaining scalable backend services, which falls outside the scope of GenAI or ML Engineering as defined in the coding book. Therefore, it is classified as Ambiguous because it is a technical role but not related to AI."
