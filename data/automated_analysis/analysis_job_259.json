While AI is mentioned as the underlying technology ('AI-powered digital employees', 'automation solutions'), the core responsibilities are about ensuring these solutions run smoothly, are optimized, and are integrated into client workflows. There are no tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). The role acts as a bridge between technology and business, supporting the client's use of AI, rather than developing the AI itself. This aligns with the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile, where the primary focus is on software engineering tasks that support or integrate AI features."
