While it mentions 'OpenAI & LLM' and 'Google Cloud Platform', these are listed as technologies the candidate might be familiar with, rather than core responsibilities. The primary focus is on building and improving software, not on developing, fine-tuning, or deploying generative AI models or predictive ML systems. Therefore, it does not align with the core responsibilities of an ML Engineer or a GenAI Engineer."
