        "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on implementing, managing, analyzing, and optimizing existing systems and processes, which are core software engineering tasks (Macro-Category A). While it involves AI (specifically ChatGPT for automation), the emphasis is on integrating and applying these solutions within business processes rather than deep model development or specialized GenAI tasks (Macro-Category B). The role also has a strong strategic component, aligning technology with business goals. This profile best fits an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer who uses AI as a tool to enhance existing business operations and systems."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is relatively clear about the responsibilities, particularly the integration and optimization of systems and the strategic discussion of automation. However, it's a new role, and the depth of 'research' into ChatGPT's possibilities is not fully detailed, leaving some room for interpretation regarding the extent of AI specialization. The mention of 'Junior ICT Manager' also suggests a broader IT role with an AI focus, rather than a pure AI/ML engineer."
