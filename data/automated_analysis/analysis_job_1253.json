            "rationale": "The job description emphasizes fine-tuning AI/ML models, building and improving data pipelines, developing and maintaining production systems, and participating in code reviews. The mention of 'vehicle assistant' and 'response quality' strongly suggests a focus on generative AI applications, aligning with the core responsibilities of a GenAI Engineer who builds and deploys user-facing systems powered by models like LLMs. While ML Engineer also involves model building and production systems, the context here leans more towards interactive AI applications rather than purely predictive modeling."
