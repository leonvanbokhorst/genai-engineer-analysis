It emphasizes 'AI-assisted development champion' and 'evaluating tools and educating the engineering team through workshops and mentorship' which aligns more with the use of AI for productivity enhancement rather than core AI engineering roles like ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer. The core responsibilities are centered around software engineering best practices, performance optimization, and cross-functional collaboration, with AI being a tool to achieve these goals."
