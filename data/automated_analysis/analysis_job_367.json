While it mentions 'generative AI' as a technology being experimented with via a simulator, the core responsibilities of the intern are to build and integrate software components. There are no explicit tasks related to developing, fine-tuning, or prompt engineering of AI models themselves (Macro-Category B). The role is about building the software infrastructure that *uses* or *experiments with* AI, rather than being an AI specialist. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is clear about the software development tasks and the technologies used. However, the mention of 'generative AI' is in the context of a simulator and experimentation, rather than direct application development with GenAI models. This makes the AI aspect secondary and more about the environment than the core task, leading to a slightly less than perfect confidence score for a role that *could* be interpreted as more AI-focused if the experimentation aspect was more central to the developer's tasks."
