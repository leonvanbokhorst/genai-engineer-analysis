The identified tasks predominantly fall under Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization), specifically using generative AI for project delivery and consulting, and overarching business understanding. This aligns with the definition of a GenAI Specialist who focuses on applying generative AI rather than building the underlying software."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is clear about the nature of the work and explicitly excludes coding, which strongly guides the profile assignment. The tasks and soft skills are well-defined within the context of AI-enhanced consulting. The score is not a 5 due to the lack of specific technology mentions beyond 'LLMs' and 'AI', and the 'Configuration Services' task not fitting neatly into the provided categories, though its context supports the overall profile."
