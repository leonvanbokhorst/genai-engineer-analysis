It explicitly states 'Coding or programming' is not part of the role, and while it mentions 'generative AI' and 'AI-enhanced project delivery', it lacks the core technical tasks and technologies associated with ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer profiles, such as algorithm development, model training, MLOps, or specific AI framework usage. The emphasis is on consulting and leveraging AI as a tool, fitting the definition of 'Ambiguous' for roles primarily focused on the use of AI tools to enhance productivity."
