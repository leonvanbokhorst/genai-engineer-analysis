However, it lacks specific details about the core responsibilities of either role, such as developing predictive models or fine-tuning generative models. The emphasis is more on data engineering and general software development within a cloud environment, making it too broad to definitively classify as either ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer. The mention of 'consultant' and 'translating customer business needs' also suggests a broader, less specialized technical role."
