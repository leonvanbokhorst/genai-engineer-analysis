However, it lacks specific details about the core tasks of model development, fine-tuning, or advanced prompt engineering that would clearly define it as either. The emphasis on consulting and translating business needs, along with a broad range of technologies without deep dives into AI-specific ones, makes it lean towards a more general or ambiguous role, potentially focused on the application of AI rather than core AI development."
