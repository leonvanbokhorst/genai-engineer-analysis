While it mentions 'generative AI' as an area for experimentation, it does not indicate a primary focus on developing, fine-tuning, or deploying generative AI models or systems. The core responsibilities and technologies listed align more with a general software engineering role rather than a specialized ML or GenAI Engineer."
