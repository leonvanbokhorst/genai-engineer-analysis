While it involves interacting with AI, the core tasks are about analyzing escalated tickets, providing feedback for AI improvement, and integrating human expertise with AI for customer support. This aligns more with using AI tools to enhance productivity and support existing systems, rather than core AI development or engineering roles like ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer. The emphasis is on 'application support' and 'customer resolutions' using AI, not on building or deeply engineering AI models or systems."
