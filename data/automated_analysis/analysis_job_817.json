While it mentions software engineering, the core focus is on applying AI models and algorithms to security problems, building scalable solutions, and enhancing cyber defense capabilities. This aligns more closely with the 'ML Engineer' profile's focus on data-driven algorithms for prediction and automation in a production environment, rather than the 'GenAI Engineer' profile's emphasis on LLMs and generative models for user-facing applications."
