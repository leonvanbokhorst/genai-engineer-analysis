The team's mission is to be the centralized hub for all machine learning (ML) recommendation initiatives, providing scalable, reusable, state-of-the-art ML models. These models aim to increase relevance and personalization, enabling customers to be context-aware and make quicker, more informed decisions. Our team supports the vision of making travelers feel understood and assisted in every step of the travel booking journey. In 2025, we are planning to focus on expanding and optimizing our recommendation systems, for example by improving personalization and leveraging GenAI to build fine-tuned models for more relevant recommendations.\n\n   We are looking for a versatile ML expert, capable of handling all aspects from system architecture to coding, encompassing ML engineering, model design, and training. You will own the design and delivery of ML systems, from initial idea generation and collecting business requirements from product stakeholders to implementation. You will work closely together with the other Machine Learning Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers as well as with Data Engineers, Software Engineers and Product Managers., * Develop production-grade ML systems, from models to features and pipelines, accounting for reliability, scalability, real-time requirements, monitoring, and retraining.\n     * Build readable and reusable code, applying code quality best practices and using standard libraries. Choose the right technology or coding methodology and refactor and simplify code when necessary.\n     * Take full ownership of services end-to-end by actively monitoring system health, performance, and business impact. Set relevant service level objectives (SLOs) and act accordingly when they are not met.\n     * Combine innovation with reuse by abstracting ML/AI concepts from one application to a generalized framework, including leveraging published research, open-source technologies, and previously-developed products at Booking.\n     * Be responsible for business-related data governance processes, technical implementation, and maintenance of data processing services and storage systems, as well as ML governance processes.\n     * Evaluate possible architecture solutions considering business and technology requirements.\n     * Contribute to the internal ML/AI community by sharing knowledge and participating in internal ML programs.\n     * Coach others through evidence and clear communication, explaining advanced technical concepts in simpler terms.\n     * Achieve mutually agreeable solutions by staying adaptable, communicating ideas in clear coherent language, and practicing active listening.\n     * Continuously evolve your craft by keeping up to date with the latest developments in ML/AI and related technologies and upskilling as needed.",
