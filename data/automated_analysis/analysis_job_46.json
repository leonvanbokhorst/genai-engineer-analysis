            "rationale": "The job description emphasizes core ML engineering responsibilities such as developing and implementing technical product specifications in Data Science, Data Engineering, and Machine Learning Engineering domains. It also highlights setting standards for engineering excellence, guiding technical colleagues, owning architectural decisions, and managing technology development phases. The focus on data science, data engineering, and ML engineering, along with the mention of 'predictive models' implicitly through 'Machine Learning Engineering domains', aligns strongly with the ML Engineer profile. While there's a software development aspect, it's in the context of supporting ML/Data Science rather than building standalone user-facing applications, which is characteristic of an ML Engineer."
