        "rationale": "The job ad heavily emphasizes traditional software engineering tasks (translating business processes into applications, microservices architecture, CI/CD, AWS Serverless) under Macro-Category A. While it mentions 'data science and generative AI', it frames this as something the full-stack developer will 'help PostNL make great strides in' by 'developing innovative solutions' and 'promoting technology'. There are no specific tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). The role is about building and integrating systems, which happen to be in the data science and generative AI domain, rather than specializing in the AI models themselves. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly defines the role as a 'Senior Software Developer' and 'senior full-stack developer' with a strong focus on software development practices and infrastructure (Python, AWS Serverless, CI/CD, microservices). The mention of 'generative AI' is present but not detailed in terms of specific AI tasks. The primary responsibilities are rooted in software engineering, making the classification relatively straightforward. A slightly lower score is given because the depth of involvement with 'generative AI' is not explicitly detailed beyond a general contribution."
