It highlights expertise in ML/GenAI for threat detection, data-driven approaches, and building scalable systems. While it mentions user-facing products, the core focus is on security services and ML-based threat detection, aligning more with the 'ML Engineer' profile's emphasis on data-driven predictive models and productionizing systems, rather than the 'GenAI Engineer's focus on language, vision, and interaction models for user-facing applications."
