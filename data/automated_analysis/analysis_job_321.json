These tasks fall predominantly under Macro-Category B, specifically '1.B.3. Data Engineering & Management', and are focused on Generative AI. There are no tasks mentioned from Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering). Therefore, the 'GenAI Specialist' profile is the most appropriate."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly defines the core AI-related tasks as providing feedback and data for training generative AI models, which maps directly to '1.B.3. Data Engineering & Management'. The absence of any tasks from Macro-Category A makes the profile assignment unambiguous. However, the ad is light on specific technologies and soft skills, and the title 'Big Data Engineer' might be a broad descriptor for the specific evaluation/annotation tasks mentioned."
