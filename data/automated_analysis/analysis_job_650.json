While there is mention of collaboration and improving the educational ecosystem (tasks from Macro-Category A, specifically 1.A.1), the core responsibility is the application of AI to generate and refine educational content, not the development or integration of AI into software systems. The role explicitly states 'you will focus on test design using AI, while our engineers handle the tech specifics' and 'Creating test content manually - you will be using generative AI tools... for every task', indicating a specialization in the AI aspect rather than a balanced engineering role. Therefore, 'GenAI Specialist' is the most fitting profile."
