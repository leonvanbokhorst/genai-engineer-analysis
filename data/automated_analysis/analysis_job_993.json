        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on tasks related to training and evaluating generative AI models by providing feedback through questions and code evaluation. While it mentions 'Back-End Ontwikkelaar' in the title, the core responsibilities described (1.B.1, 1.B.2) are predominantly in the AI Specialization category (Macro-Category B), specifically related to Generative AI. There are no tasks described that fall under Core Software Engineering (Macro-Category A). Therefore, the 'GenAI Specialist' profile is the most appropriate fit."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the tasks related to AI model training and evaluation using human feedback. While the title mentions 'Back-End Ontwikkelaar', the detailed responsibilities are specific to AI tasks. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, because the 'Back-End Ontwikkelaar' title might suggest some software engineering integration tasks that are not explicitly detailed in the description."
