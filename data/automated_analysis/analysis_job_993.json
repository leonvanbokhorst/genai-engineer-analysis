            "rationale": "The job description focuses on providing human feedback to train AI models, specifically by crafting and evaluating code generated by AI. While it mentions 'generative AI models' and 'large language models', the core tasks described do not involve building, fine-tuning, or deploying these models from an engineering perspective. Instead, it emphasizes human evaluation and data generation for training, which aligns more with data annotation or quality assurance roles rather than an engineering role focused on model development or application building. The description lacks the core responsibilities and evidence profile of an ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer as defined in the coding book, such as algorithm development, MLOps, RAG systems, or prompt engineering. It is more about using AI outputs for training data rather than engineering the AI systems themselves."
