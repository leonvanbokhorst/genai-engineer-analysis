        "rationale": "The job title 'MLOps Engineer' strongly suggests a focus on the operational aspects of machine learning, which falls under Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering) as defined in the coding book, specifically `1.A.2. Operations & MLOps (LLMOps)`. Since the advertisement provides no details on tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or data engineering for ML (Macro-Category B), the role is predominantly focused on engineering. The `AI-Adjacent Software Engineer` profile is the most fitting among the given options, as it describes roles that build or maintain software supporting AI/ML models. However, the absence of any distinction between traditional ML and Generative AI makes it impossible to assign a more specific profile like `Core ML Engineer` or `Core GenAI Engineer`."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 1,
        "reasoning": "The job advertisement is extremely minimal, containing only the job title. This leaves no specific details about tasks, technologies, or soft skills, making a thorough analysis impossible. The classification and profile assignment are based solely on the interpretation of the job title 'MLOps Engineer' and its alignment with the `1.A.2. Operations & MLOps (LLMOps)` category."
