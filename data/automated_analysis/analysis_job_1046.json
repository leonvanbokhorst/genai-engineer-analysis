        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on collaborating with product teams, analyzing business problems, and developing/productionizing ML systems end-to-end. While it mentions ML solutions, it does not specify Generative AI tasks or traditional ML model development/fine-tuning as the primary focus. The emphasis is on integrating and delivering ML solutions within broader business contexts, aligning with Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration) and Business Understanding, rather than deep specialization in Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization or ML Specialization). Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the collaborative nature of the role and the end-to-end delivery of ML solutions. However, it lacks specific details about the types of ML models or technologies used, and it doesn't explicitly mention Generative AI. This ambiguity prevents a perfect score but still allows for a confident classification."
