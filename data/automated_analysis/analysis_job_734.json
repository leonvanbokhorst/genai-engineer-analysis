While it mentions a 'new offering that focuses on K8s.', it lacks specific details about AI, machine learning, or generative models, which are central to the ML Engineer and GenAI Engineer profiles. The role appears to be a traditional software engineering position with a specialization in Kubernetes, rather than an AI-focused role."
