            "rationale": "The job description focuses on providing human feedback to train AI models, specifically by crafting and evaluating code generated by AI. While it mentions 'generative AI models' and 'large language models', the core tasks described do not involve the development, fine-tuning, or deployment of these models from an engineering perspective. Instead, it emphasizes human evaluation and data generation for training, which aligns more with data annotation or quality assurance roles rather than a core AI engineering function. The role does not require deep technical skills in model building, MLOps, or software development for AI applications, making it fall outside the scope of ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer."
