While it mentions Generative AI and LLMs, the core responsibilities revolve around building and managing the cloud-native infrastructure and systems that support these AI products, rather than developing or fine-tuning the AI models themselves. The tasks are predominantly in Macro-Category A (Software Engineering & Operations), with a clear emphasis on integrating and operationalizing AI components. There are no explicit tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, or deep GenAI specialization (Macro-Category B). Therefore, it fits the profile of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

However, the initial title 'CLOUD ENGINEER' and the emphasis on infrastructure and operational tasks, rather than core AI model development, make the profile assignment slightly less definitive than a role explicitly stating 'GenAI Engineer' with model-centric tasks. The mention of 'Generative AI' and 'LLM technologies' is present but secondary to the cloud engineering aspects."
