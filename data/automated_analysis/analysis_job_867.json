While generative AI tools like GPT-4 Vision are mentioned, the primary focus is on transforming business efficiency through automation and scalable solutions, which is a hallmark of ML Engineering rather than a pure GenAI application development role. The mention of 'autonomous AI systems' and 'scalable solutions without human intervention' further supports the ML Engineer profile, focusing on the operationalization and efficiency gains through AI."
