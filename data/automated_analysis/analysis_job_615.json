The focus on 'fine-tuning LLMs' and 'agentic flow' leans towards GenAI, while the broader software engineering aspects are also prominent. This combination fits the 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines both software engineering and AI-specific responsibilities. The mention of 'fine-tuning LLMs' and 'agentic flow' provides good indicators for the AI specialization. However, it lacks explicit mention of specific GenAI frameworks (like LangChain) or specific LLMs, which would have made the classification even more definitive. The soft skills are also well-represented. Overall, the ad is quite clear, but a few more specific GenAI technology mentions would elevate the confidence to 5."
