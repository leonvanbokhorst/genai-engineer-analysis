            "rationale": "The job description is for a QA Manual Engineer, focusing on traditional manual testing, defect management, and process improvement within an Agile development environment. It does not involve the core responsibilities or technologies associated with ML Engineering or GenAI Engineering, such as algorithm development, model training, fine-tuning, RAG systems, or generative model deployment. While it mentions 'cutting-edge technology and 3D content automation,' the role itself is defined by manual QA tasks, making it a non-technical or traditional software engineering role rather than an AI-focused engineering position."
