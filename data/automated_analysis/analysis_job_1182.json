It also emphasizes MLOps practices ('you build it, you run it', 'CICD', 'ML Ops platform uit'). While there's a mention of 'ML modellen binnen het domein van digital advertising', there is no specific mention of Generative AI, LLMs, RAG, or related concepts. The tasks are predominantly focused on traditional ML model implementation and the surrounding software engineering and MLOps infrastructure. Therefore, 'Core ML Engineer' is the most fitting profile."
