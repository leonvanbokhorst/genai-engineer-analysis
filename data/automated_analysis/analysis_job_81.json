It explicitly details a procurement and proposal process, making it unambiguous that it does not contain information about job tasks, technologies, or soft skills related to a specific role like a GenAI Engineer. Therefore, the confidence in classifying it as 'Not Relevant' based on the absence of such information is very high."
