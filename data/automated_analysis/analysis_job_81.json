While it mentions supporting LLM applications, it does not detail core generative AI tasks like fine-tuning, RAG development, or advanced prompt engineering. The primary focus is on building robust backend systems and infrastructure, which aligns more with traditional software engineering than a specialized GenAI Engineer role. It lacks the depth in generative modeling and application development characteristic of a GenAI Engineer."
