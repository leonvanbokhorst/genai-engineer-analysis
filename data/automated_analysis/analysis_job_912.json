While it mentions 'large language model support' and working with 'deep learning software engineers', the core responsibilities are focused on building and improving the software stack that *supports* these AI technologies, rather than the deep specialization in model development or GenAI specific tasks like prompt engineering or RAG. The role integrates AI/ML features into a product (NVIDIA's AI software stack) but the primary focus remains on the software engineering aspects."

The AI/ML aspect is present but framed as support for the software stack. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as 'tuning' and 'LLM support' could have slightly more ambiguity without further context, though the overall emphasis leans heavily towards software engineering."
