It mentions 'AI-driven innovations' and 'AI-driven solutions' but does not detail the development, fine-tuning, or deployment of core AI models themselves. The emphasis is on using AI as a productivity enhancer within a software engineering context, rather than building AI systems. This aligns with the definition of the 'Ambiguous' profile, which includes roles primarily focused on the 'USE of AI tools to enhance productivity' and 'AI-assisted programming'."
