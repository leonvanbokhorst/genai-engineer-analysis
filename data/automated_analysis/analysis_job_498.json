While it mentions 'GenAI features', the core responsibilities and tasks described (security research, red-team exercises, code review, vulnerability analysis, system analysis, defining and driving security projects) are all firmly rooted in traditional software engineering practices, specifically within the domain of security. There are no tasks related to developing, fine-tuning, or deploying AI models themselves, nor are there tasks related to prompt engineering or RAG. The role is about securing existing software and systems, not building AI capabilities. Therefore, it fits the 'Software Engineer' profile, as it's a software role that does not integrate AI/ML into the product's core functionality, but rather focuses on the security of the software itself."

        "reasoning": "The job description is very clear and specific about the tasks and focus of the role. The mention of 'GenAI features' is in the context of the devices being secured, not as a core development area for the engineer. The tasks described are consistently related to offensive security and software analysis, aligning well with the 'Software Engineer' profile as defined in the coding book."
