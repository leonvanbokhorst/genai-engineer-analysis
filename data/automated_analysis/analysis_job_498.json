            "rationale": "The job description focuses on developing tools and infrastructure to automate privacy compliance tasks and integrate privacy by design principles. While it involves software development and potentially some data analysis for risk estimation, it does not heavily emphasize core ML/GenAI modeling, engineering, or deployment in the way an ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer role would. The primary goal is compliance automation and process optimization, rather than building predictive or generative AI models. Therefore, it falls under the 'Ambiguous' category as it's primarily a software development role focused on a specific domain (privacy engineering) rather than a core AI/ML engineering role."
