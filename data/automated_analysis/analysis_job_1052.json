While it mentions researching and implementing AI tooling like LLMs, this is presented as an innovation task within a broader cloud operations and integration role, rather than the primary focus. The majority of the tasks fall under Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration, Operations & MLOps), with a smaller component of AI Specialization (Model Development & Fine-Tuning). This distribution aligns best with the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile, where AI/ML features are integrated into a product or system, but the core of the role is software engineering."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to cloud infrastructure management and mentions AI tooling as a secondary focus for innovation. The distinction between core cloud engineering and AI specialization is reasonably clear, leading to a high confidence score. However, the depth of AI involvement is not extensively detailed, preventing a perfect score."
