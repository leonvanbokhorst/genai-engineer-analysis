        "rationale": "The job ad emphasizes traditional software development tasks such as building products from scratch, developing prototypes, backend and API development, and iterative improvement. While it mentions leveraging generative AI and conversational agents, the core responsibility is to integrate these technologies into a user-friendly product. The role is primarily focused on the software engineering aspect (Macro-Category A) with AI/ML as a component being integrated, rather than deep model development or specialization (Macro-Category B). Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software development responsibilities and mentions the use of generative AI as a feature to be integrated. It lacks specific details on the AI/ML models themselves or advanced AI tasks, which makes it less ambiguous for classification. The confidence is high, but not perfect, as the extent of 'leveraging new technologies' could be interpreted in slightly different ways, though the emphasis remains on product development."
