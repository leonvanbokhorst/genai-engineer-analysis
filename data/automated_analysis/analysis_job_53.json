While it involves data, it does not mention any specific AI/ML model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG tasks. The role is about building and maintaining data systems, which aligns with core software engineering principles. The collaboration aspects are also standard for software development roles. Therefore, it fits the 'Software Engineer' profile as it does not integrate AI/ML into the product itself, but rather focuses on the underlying data systems."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about its focus on data infrastructure and architecture development, which strongly points towards a software engineering role. However, it doesn't explicitly mention AI/ML technologies, making it difficult to assign a more specialized AI profile. The absence of specific AI/ML tasks leads to a high confidence in the 'Software Engineer' classification, but not a perfect 5 as the 'Data Engineer' title might imply deeper data science or ML operations, which are not detailed here."
