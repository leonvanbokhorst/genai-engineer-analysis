However, it lacks specific details about developing, fine-tuning, or deploying generative AI models, RAG systems, or advanced prompt engineering, which are core to the GenAI Engineer profile. The primary focus remains on traditional software development for mobile applications, making it fall under the 'Ambiguous' category as it's not a dedicated AI role."
