            "profile": "Ambiguous",
            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on leadership, product vision, and team building rather than specific technical AI/ML tasks. While it mentions an 'AI-powered recruitment platform', it lacks details on model development, data engineering, or specific generative AI techniques, making it difficult to classify as an ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer. The emphasis on 'leading development', 'guiding a tech team', and 'strategic leadership' suggests a CTO role that is not solely focused on AI/ML implementation."
