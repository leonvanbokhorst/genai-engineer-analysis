        "rationale": "The job ad explicitly states 'Staff Software Engineer, Backend' and mentions joining an 'ML Platform team'. However, it also clarifies 'ML background is not required'. The core responsibility described is that of a Software Engineer, without any specific tasks related to AI/ML model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. Therefore, it falls under the 'Software Engineer' profile."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job title and the explicit mention that an ML background is not required make the classification as 'Software Engineer' quite clear. However, the brevity of the ad means there's a slight lack of detail on the specific *type* of software engineering tasks, which prevents a perfect score."
