            "rationale": "The job description focuses on frontend development tasks using React, Next.js, and Node.js, with integration to a Python backend. While it mentions 'Generative AI outputs' in the context of an image editing canvas, the core responsibilities and required skills are centered around traditional frontend development and user interface enhancement, rather than the design, development, fine-tuning, or deployment of generative models themselves. There is no mention of LLMs, RAG, PEFT, or specific generative AI frameworks. Therefore, it does not align with the 'GenAI Engineer' or 'ML Engineer' profiles and falls under 'Ambiguous' as it's primarily a traditional software engineering role with a tangential mention of AI outputs."
