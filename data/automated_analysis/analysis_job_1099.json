        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on developing and improving software platforms (1.A.1) that utilize LLMs, such as autonomous support platforms and AI assistants. While it mentions testing and integrating AI technologies (1.B.1) and using specific LLM tools (GPT-4 Vision, Amazon CodeWhisperer), the core emphasis is on building and maintaining these systems within existing infrastructures (AWS) and supporting internal teams. The role is about integrating AI capabilities into broader software solutions rather than deep model development or specialized GenAI research. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile, where the primary focus is software engineering with AI integration."
