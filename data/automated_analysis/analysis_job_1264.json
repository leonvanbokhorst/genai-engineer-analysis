            "rationale": "The job description focuses on traditional Quality Assurance (QA) tasks such as developing test plans, executing manual and automated tests, bug reporting, and regression testing. While it mentions staying updated with industry trends and technologies in software testing, it does not contain any specific keywords or responsibilities related to Machine Learning, Generative AI, or advanced AI modeling techniques. The core responsibilities are centered around ensuring software quality through testing, which falls outside the scope of ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer profiles. Therefore, it is classified as Ambiguous as it is a technical role but not directly related to AI/ML engineering as defined in the coding book."
