It also includes tasks related to integrating data sources for LLM knowledge bases (Macro-Category B). The emphasis on LLM agents, frameworks, and the MLOps platform, combined with the software engineering aspects, points towards a 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile. The statement 'We do not create models ourselves; we are a platform team' suggests the focus is on building the infrastructure and applications around AI rather than core model research or development, but the integration and management of LLM agents and MLOps platform firmly place it in the AI/GenAI domain."
