While it supports ML development, the core tasks are centered around the operational and engineering aspects of the ML platform rather than the development or fine-tuning of ML models themselves. There is no mention of specific ML algorithms, model development, or generative AI tasks. Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, as it involves building and maintaining the software infrastructure that enables ML work."

The tasks described align directly with MLOps and platform engineering, with no ambiguity regarding core ML model development or GenAI specialization. This clarity leads to high confidence in the analysis and profile assignment."
