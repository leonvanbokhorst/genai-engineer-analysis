There is no mention of AI/ML model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, RAG, or any AI-specific specialization. The mention of Kafka, a data streaming platform, falls under data pipelines/MLOps but is used here in a software engineering context rather than for AI model training or deployment. Therefore, the role is classified as a Software Engineer."

There are no ambiguous terms or mentions of AI/ML that would suggest a different profile. The classification is straightforward based on the provided text and the coding book."
