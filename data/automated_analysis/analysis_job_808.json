While it mentions exploring integrations with Dify for LLM capabilities, this is a minor aspect and not the core focus. The role emphasizes business process automation and traditional software development over advanced generative AI model development, fine-tuning, or building complex GenAI applications. Therefore, it does not align with the core responsibilities of a GenAI Engineer or ML Engineer."
