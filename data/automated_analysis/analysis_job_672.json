While it mentions AI technologies like GPT-4, RAG, and generative AI, these are primarily presented as tools to enhance existing software products or build new AI-driven features within them, rather than focusing on core AI model development or deep specialization in generative AI research. The role's output is software applications with AI capabilities, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile. There is a mention of 'implementing machine learning algorithms for predictive insights' and 'data analytics modules', which could lean towards traditional ML, but the overall context and the specific examples (RAG, GPT-4 integration) point more towards leveraging GenAI within a software engineering framework. The emphasis is on 'integrating AI into software engineering' and using AI tools to improve development efficiency."

The language used consistently points towards software engineering augmented by AI, rather than a deep AI research or ML modeling role. The distinction between using AI tools and building AI models is well-defined by the described responsibilities."
