While AI and GenAI are mentioned as areas of focus and trends to stay updated on, there are no specific tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. The role is about integrating AI into production processes rather than developing AI models themselves. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities that fall under software development and integration, with AI being a key technology to integrate. However, it lacks specific details about the AI/ML tasks themselves, making it impossible to classify it as a Core GenAI or Core ML role. The confidence is high for the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' classification due to the strong emphasis on process optimization and integration."
