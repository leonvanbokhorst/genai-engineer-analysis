This aligns strongly with the definition of a GenAI Engineer who focuses on designing, developing, and deploying applications built on generative models, particularly those involving language and interaction. While there's collaboration and integration, the core focus is on building AI-powered conversational agents, not predictive modeling or traditional data engineering."
