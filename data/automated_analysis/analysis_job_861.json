The described tasks, such as tackling \"complex greenfield projects,\" implementing \"event sourcing,\" and working with \"microservices,\" all fall under `1.A.1. Software Development & Integration`. While \"generative AI\" is mentioned as a technical area for training, there are no explicit responsibilities or requirements related to developing, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or integrating generative AI models into the product. The focus remains on core software engineering principles and practices."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the core responsibilities being software engineering. The mention of \"generative AI\" is in the context of training, not as a primary job function. The role title itself is \"Software Engineer\". The only reason it's not a 5 is that \"generative AI\" is mentioned, which could imply some level of interaction, but the detailed tasks do not support this. The ad is detailed enough to confidently classify it as a traditional software engineering role."
