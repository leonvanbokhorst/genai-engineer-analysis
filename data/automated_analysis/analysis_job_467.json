            "rationale": "The job description focuses on backend service development using C# for a document translation service. While it mentions 'DeepL's Document Translation service', it does not detail any specific involvement with Generative AI models, LLMs, RAG, or fine-tuning. The core responsibilities revolve around traditional backend engineering, service maintenance, monitoring, and cross-team collaboration, which are not core to ML or GenAI engineering roles as defined in the coding book. The mention of 'hacking sessions' and 'learning budget' are general benefits and not indicative of specific AI development tasks. Therefore, it does not fit the 'ML Engineer' or 'GenAI Engineer' profiles and is classified as 'Ambiguous' as it is a traditional software engineering role."
