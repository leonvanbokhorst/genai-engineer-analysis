While it mentions integrating 'advanced neural networks' and 'AI technologies', the focus is on the integration and operationalization of these models within existing services, rather than the development or fine-tuning of the models themselves (Macro-Category B). The role is about building the software infrastructure that *uses* AI, not about building the AI models. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

The primary language is English, and the tasks are well-defined. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, because the specific nature of the 'advanced neural networks' and how deeply they are integrated is not elaborated upon, leaving a slight ambiguity about the depth of AI involvement beyond integration."
