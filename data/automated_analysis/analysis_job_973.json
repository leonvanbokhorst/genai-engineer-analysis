It emphasizes human feedback for training and evaluating AI outputs, which aligns more with using AI tools for productivity or as a subject of interaction rather than core AI engineering. There is a lack of specific technical tasks related to AI model development, data engineering for AI, or MLOps, which are central to ML Engineer and GenAI Engineer roles."
