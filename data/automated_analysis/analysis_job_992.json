            "rationale": "The job description focuses on providing human feedback to train AI models, specifically by crafting and answering computer science questions and evaluating AI-generated code. While it involves AI models, it does not require the core responsibilities of an ML Engineer (building predictive models, MLOps) or a GenAI Engineer (designing, developing, fine-tuning LLMs, building RAG systems, developing agents). The role is more about human-in-the-loop data generation and evaluation for AI training rather than direct AI model development or application building. It lacks the depth in core AI engineering tasks and technologies to fit the other profiles."
