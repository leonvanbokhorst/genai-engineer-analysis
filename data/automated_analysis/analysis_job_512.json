It emphasizes implementation and collaboration rather than the creation or adaptation of predictive or generative models, aligning more with a traditional engineering or operations role that utilizes AI/ML outputs rather than developing them. Therefore, it does not fit the specific criteria for ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer."
