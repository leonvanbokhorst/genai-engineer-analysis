While 'generative AI' is mentioned, it's in the context of 'use of generative AI' as one step among many in the R&D process, rather than a core focus on developing or fine-tuning GenAI models themselves. The primary output is software that supports biological research and lab automation, making it an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer role."

However, the specific nature of the 'generative AI' usage is not deeply detailed, and the emphasis is clearly on the software engineering and automation aspects within a life science domain. The classification is strong, but a slightly higher score would require more explicit detail on the AI components."
