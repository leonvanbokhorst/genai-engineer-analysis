            "rationale": "The job description focuses on using AI models to train other AI models by crafting questions and evaluating code. While it mentions 'generative AI models' and 'large language models', it does not involve building, fine-tuning, or deploying these models directly. The core tasks described are more aligned with data annotation and evaluation for AI training rather than engineering or development of AI systems. The role is described as a 'Full Stack Developer - AI Fact Checker' but the responsibilities do not align with typical full-stack development or core AI engineering tasks. There is no mention of MLOps, data engineering, or core modeling tasks. The emphasis is on human feedback for AI training, which falls outside the scope of ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer profiles. Therefore, the 'Ambiguous' profile is the most appropriate."
