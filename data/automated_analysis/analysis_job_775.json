We are responsible for making the things you see in the browser work securely, quickly, and well! We are looking for a Staff Machine Learning Engineer to help us develop and grow new Generative AI driven products and tools. You will play a key role in enabling safe and healthy machine learning and Generative AI driven experiences in Firefox.\n   What is a Staff Engineer at Mozilla?\n   A Staff Engineer is the next level from a Senior Engineer. At Mozilla this role can vary but typically a Staff Engineer is a domain expert who leads others within a single team to tackle multi-month projects. Tasks that may be initially ambiguous or require significant planning and require them to influence or direct the work of several engineers. They sequence deliverables and manage risks in their team's projects, provide feedback on our strategy and goals affecting the team, and turn our strategy into action for their team members. Staff Engineers mentor others by stewarding some responsibilities to more junior and senior engineers so they can take on new ones. They collaborate with management on building team consensus and providing direction. Staff Engineers identify gaps and opportunities for improvement to enable a culture of inclusion and allyship, at all levels of the organization.\n   What youll do:\n\n   Lead the design, development, and integration of Generative AI solutions in Firefox, collaborating cross functionally with product management, full stack engineering and design.\n   Build infrastructure for training and inference of LLMs and small language and vision models for use cases on the web and mobile Firefox product experiences.\n   Implement robust validation and testing procedures to ensure the developed models' generalizability and reliability\n   Continuously monitor and optimize deployed models for performance and efficiency",
