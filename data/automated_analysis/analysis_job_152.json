While it mentions cloud initiatives and optimizing infrastructure, it lacks any specific mention of AI/ML models, generative AI techniques, or related development tasks. The core responsibilities align more with traditional cloud engineering and operations rather than the specialized areas of ML Engineering or GenAI Engineering. Therefore, it falls under the 'Ambiguous' category as it is not primarily an AI-focused technical role."
