The mention of working with 'nieuwste technologieën en methodologieën uit Silicon Valley' further supports a focus on advanced AI, specifically GenAI. The 'Teamlead' aspect suggests a balanced role, fitting the 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is relatively concise but clearly outlines both software development responsibilities and specific GenAI technologies. The profile assignment is strongly supported by the explicit mention of LLMs and agentic frameworks. A slightly lower score is given because some details about the 'optimization' and 'implementation' aspects could be more granular, and the specific technologies within 'agentic AI-frameworks' are not detailed."
