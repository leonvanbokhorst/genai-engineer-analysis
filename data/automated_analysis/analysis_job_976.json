            "rationale": "The job description focuses on using human feedback to train AI models by crafting questions and evaluating code generated by AI. While it mentions 'generative AI models' and 'large language models', it does not involve the core engineering tasks of building, fine-tuning, or deploying these models, nor does it require deep ML expertise. The role is more about human-in-the-loop data generation and evaluation for AI training, which aligns with the 'use of AI tools to enhance productivity' or 'educational' aspects of the Ambiguous profile, rather than a direct AI engineering role."
