        "rationale": "The job ad focuses exclusively on tasks related to training and evaluating generative AI models ('help train AI models', 'train AI large language models', 'Evaluating and ranking code generated by AI models'). While it mentions 'experienced software engineer', the core responsibilities described fall under Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization) and do not involve traditional software development or integration (Macro-Category A). There are no mentions of software development, integration, MLOps, or traditional ML tasks. Therefore, the 'GenAI Specialist' profile is the most appropriate fit."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is clear about the core tasks involving AI model training and evaluation. However, it lacks detail on specific technologies or the depth of involvement in model development versus data preparation. The mention of 'experienced software engineer' could be interpreted in multiple ways, but the tasks themselves strongly point towards a specialist role. The confidence is high but not perfect due to the limited scope of the description."
