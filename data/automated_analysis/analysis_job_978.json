Phrases like 'help train AI models', 'train generative artificial intelligence models', 'Crafting and answering questions related to computer science in order to help train AI models', and 'Evaluating and ranking code generated by AI models' all fall under Macro-Category B: GenAI Specialization, specifically 'Model Development & Fine-Tuning'. There are no tasks mentioned that fall under Macro-Category A: Core Software Engineering. While it mentions 'experienced software engineer', the core responsibilities are centered on the AI model training process itself, not on integrating these models into software applications or managing their deployment. Therefore, the role is best classified as a specialist focused on the AI model development aspect."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the core tasks related to AI model training and evaluation. However, it lacks specific details about the technologies or the exact nature of the 'computer science' questions, which prevents a perfect score. The profile assignment is strongly supported by the described tasks."
