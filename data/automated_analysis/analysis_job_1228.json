        "rationale": "The job description emphasizes traditional software engineering tasks such as deploying production-ready pipelines and ML models on the cloud using Python, and being responsible for project delivery. It also includes business-oriented tasks like understanding customer needs, translating them into technical solutions, and assisting sales. While it mentions exploring ML research and guiding junior engineers, there's no specific focus on Generative AI tasks like prompt engineering or RAG, nor a deep dive into traditional ML model development itself. The role appears to be about integrating and delivering ML-powered solutions within a broader business and client context, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the responsibilities, leaning heavily towards software engineering and client-facing/business understanding tasks. The mention of 'ML models' is general and doesn't specify GenAI or traditional ML, but the overall emphasis on deployment, client solutions, and sales support points towards an AI-adjacent software engineering role. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, due to the lack of explicit detail on the *type* of ML models or specific GenAI technologies."
