While it's an internship, the blend of these two areas, with a specific focus on LLMs, points towards a Core GenAI Engineer profile. The role involves building and integrating LLM capabilities, which requires both software engineering practices and GenAI-specific knowledge."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines tasks related to both software development (scripting) and GenAI (LLM proof-of-concept). The mention of 'asking questions to documents' strongly suggests RAG. The internship nature means the depth of these tasks might be less than a full-time role, but the intent is clear. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, due to the 'internship' context which implies a learning and exploratory phase rather than full production deployment."
