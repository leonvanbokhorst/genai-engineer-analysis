            "rationale": "The job description is for a 'Data Engineer' but the responsibilities described are very broad and lean towards consultancy and business understanding rather than deep technical AI/ML engineering. While it mentions NLP, time series modeling, and image recognition, it doesn't specify building or fine-tuning models, nor does it mention specific generative AI technologies or frameworks. The focus is on translating business demands into solutions, data analysis, and leading less experienced colleagues, which aligns more with a consulting or general data role rather than a specialized ML or GenAI Engineer."
