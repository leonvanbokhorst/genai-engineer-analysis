        "rationale": "The job primarily focuses on Business Intelligence development tasks (data visualization, client consultation), which fall under Macro-Category A. While AI is mentioned, it's in the context of accelerating existing BI solutions, suggesting integration rather than core AI model development. The only task in Macro-Category B is data pipeline development, which is a general data engineering task. The strong emphasis on Macro-Category A tasks with AI as an enhancement leads to the AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

However, the specific nature of the AI integration ('Use AI to accelerate') is somewhat general, preventing a perfect score. The overall intent is discernible, but more detail on the AI aspect would increase confidence."
