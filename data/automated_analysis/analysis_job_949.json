            "rationale": "The job description focuses on using AI models for training and evaluation, specifically crafting questions and evaluating code generated by AI. While it mentions 'generative AI models' and 'large language models', it lacks the core responsibilities and technical depth expected of an ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer, such as algorithm development, model fine-tuning, RAG systems, or productionizing models. The emphasis is on human feedback for training, which aligns more with using AI tools to enhance productivity rather than developing or engineering AI systems. Therefore, it falls under the 'Ambiguous' category as it primarily focuses on the use of AI tools for training and evaluation rather than core AI engineering tasks."
