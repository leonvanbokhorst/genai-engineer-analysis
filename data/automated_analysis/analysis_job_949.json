        "score": 3,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is clear about the general domain (ML/data applications) and the context (NOS digital products). However, it lacks specific details about the technologies, the exact nature of the algorithms, or the depth of the integration/development tasks. This makes a precise classification slightly challenging, particularly in distinguishing the exact balance between A and B tasks."
