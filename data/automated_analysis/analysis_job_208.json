            "profile": "Ambiguous",
            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on traditional software engineering tasks (Java, platform architecture, scalability, reliability) and mentions the use of AI tools for development efficiency and to revolutionize plan creation. However, it lacks specific details about building, fine-tuning, or deploying generative models, RAG systems, or complex AI agents, which are core to the GenAI Engineer profile. The emphasis is more on leveraging AI as a tool rather than developing AI-centric applications. Therefore, it falls under the 'Ambiguous' category as it's primarily a software engineering role that *uses* AI, rather than an AI development role."
