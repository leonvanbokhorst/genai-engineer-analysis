This aligns strongly with the core responsibilities of a GenAI Engineer, particularly in developing and maintaining production-grade user-facing software systems built on AI models, and the associated MLOps and software development aspects. While ML Engineers also work with models, the focus here is on the application and integration into user workflows and SaaS platforms, which is more characteristic of a GenAI Engineer."
