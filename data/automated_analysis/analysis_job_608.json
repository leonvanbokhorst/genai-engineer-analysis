Additionally, you will support other teams with our MLOps platform to create and deploy ML models, while keeping a keen eye on cloud and MLOps best practices. Furthermore, you will play an active role in enhancing the AI skills of yourself, your team members, and colleagues by following and sharing the latest developments in the field. Finally, together with your team, you will carry operational responsibility for our tools and services.\n\n   As a team, we offer two products: the Voltix Assistant and the Voltix MLOps platform. The Voltix Assistant product will provide a smooth, standardized rollout of LLM agents for various internal use cases. The main focus of these use cases will be to make the right knowledge easily accessible within our large organization. With the Voltix MLOps platform, we help other teams get started quickly and accurately through a standardized AWS cloud environment, both for developing, testing, and deploying ML models, as well as for conducting data analyses. We do not create models ourselves; we are a platform team.\n\n   We are creating the energy grid of the future, for everyone, with everyone. And as AI Engineer, you can play your part in this. Your role will involve:\n     * Translating LLM use cases into technical solutions and standardized solutions for multiple use cases where possible.\n     * Implementing, rolling out, and managing LLM agents, with a preference for existing frameworks and LLM models.\n     * Integrating internal data sources (such as SharePoint and Confluence) as a knowledge base for the LLM agents.\n     * Embedding LLM agents into end-user tools, such as Microsoft Teams.\n     * Maintaining the MLOps platform on AWS for secure and controlled delivery of ML models by data science teams.\n\n   You complete our network\n\n   Did you know that Alliander is made up of different companies? Together with Liander, Qirion, Qterra, Dep, Firan and Entrnce, we develop and manage the energy grid for millions of people in the Netherlands. And in the light of the current energy transition, that is no easy task. We are realising this transition with a large group of talented professionals. Thanks to them, we have every confidence that we will be able to safeguard the Netherlands' energy future. Together with you, we will make this happen.\n\n   Having a mindset in which only the best is good enough is only possible with the right motivation. As a member of the AI Acceleration team, you'll be part of a young and dynamic team made up of a Product Owner, Tech Lead, Scrum Master, and six AI engineers. Together, we leverage our experience with AWS, MLOps, and data science to accelerate AI advancements at Alliander.
