        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on 'Software Development & Integration' tasks (1.A.1), such as developing and integrating ML solutions end-to-end and delivering software artifacts. While it mentions 'ML solutions' and 'model artifacts', the emphasis is on the engineering and integration aspects rather than deep model development or specialization in Generative AI. There are no specific mentions of Generative AI tasks or technologies, nor traditional ML model development tasks. The role involves collaborating with product and data science teams to deliver these solutions, fitting the profile of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer who builds or maintains software that uses AI/ML as a core part of its functionality."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to software development and integration of ML solutions. However, it lacks specific details about the types of ML models or the specific technologies used, which prevents a perfect score. The absence of explicit Generative AI mentions steers it away from Core GenAI Engineer, and the focus on integration and delivery of 'software and model artifacts' solidifies the AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."
