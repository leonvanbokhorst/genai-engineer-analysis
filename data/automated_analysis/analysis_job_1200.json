It includes building traditional ML models (1.B.1) for prediction and segmentation, fine-tuning LLMs (1.B.2), designing and architecting solutions (1.A.1), and deploying MLOps pipelines (1.A.2). While LLMs are mentioned, the core emphasis on building predictive models and the explicit mention of 'machine learning models' alongside 'generative AI applications' suggests a stronger leaning towards traditional ML, but with a significant component of GenAI. The role requires integration and deployment, fitting the 'balanced mix' criteria. Given the explicit mention of both traditional ML tasks and LLM fine-tuning, 'Core ML Engineer' is the most fitting profile, as the traditional ML tasks are more detailed and foundational to the role's description than the GenAI tasks, which are more specific (fine-tuning LLMs)."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to both traditional ML and Generative AI, as well as software engineering aspects like design, architecture, and MLOps. The mention of 'Data Scientist / AI Engineer' title and the specific tasks like building predictive models and fine-tuning LLMs provide good evidence for classification. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the balance between traditional ML and GenAI could be slightly more explicit to definitively distinguish between 'Core ML Engineer' and 'Core GenAI Engineer' if the LLM fine-tuning was more central."
