        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on tasks related to Generative AI, specifically mentioning 'large language models (LLM's)', 'text models', and the design/implementation of AI solutions based on them. It includes tasks like dataset preparation for model performance (1.B.3), improving text model quality (1.B.1), and testing/optimizing solutions (1.A.2). While there's a mention of continuous training in new technologies (3.2), the core responsibilities are squarely within Generative AI model development and optimization. There are no explicit mentions of traditional ML tasks or purely software engineering tasks without an AI component. The mention of 'veilige en verantwoorde toepassing van AI-technologieën' (safe and responsible application of AI technologies) also points to a specialized AI role. Therefore, 'Core GenAI Engineer' is the most fitting profile."
    },
    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines tasks related to Generative AI, LLMs, and model improvement. However, it lacks specific technology mentions (like Python, LangChain, etc.) and explicit software engineering tasks (like building microservices or CI/CD pipelines). The soft skills are also implied rather than explicitly stated with detailed phrases. This makes the analysis strong but not entirely definitive on all fronts."
