While it mentions AI and DevSecOps, it does not involve the core development, fine-tuning, or deployment of AI models or systems. The primary responsibilities are related to pre-sales technical engagement and customer relationship management, which falls outside the scope of ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer roles as defined in the coding book. It is more of a technical sales or solutions architecture role, making it 'Ambiguous' according to the provided criteria."
