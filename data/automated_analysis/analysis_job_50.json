While there are mentions of creating and supervising content (which can be seen as a form of output generation, aligning loosely with Macro-Category A), the core focus and the majority of specific tasks described are centered around the application and understanding of GenAI technologies, particularly prompt engineering. There is no mention of traditional ML tasks or core software engineering responsibilities like building backend services, CI/CD, or model deployment infrastructure. Therefore, the role leans towards specialization in GenAI rather than a balanced engineering role."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly defines the role as 'Copywriter/Prompt Engineer' and focuses heavily on prompt engineering and generative AI tools. The tasks described are specific to GenAI specialization. However, the 'Software Development & Integration' tasks are described in the context of content creation rather than traditional software engineering, which makes the classification lean towards 'GenAI Specialist' rather than a 'Core GenAI Engineer' which would require a more balanced mix of both macro-categories. The confidence is high due to the clarity of the GenAI focus, but not a perfect 5 because the 'software engineering' aspect is interpreted through content creation."
