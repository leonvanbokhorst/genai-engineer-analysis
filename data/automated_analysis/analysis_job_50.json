You accomplish this by considering a myriad of factors: the content strategy, channel specifications, the customer journey, best practices, data, tone of voice, and an outside-in approach. Sounds like a lot of variables, but you are adept at performance-based, audience-first content creation. You've honed this skill over years of experience.\n\n   For the past few months, you've been mastering the art of prompt engineering. Not only are you well-versed with the current generative AI tools and features, but you also stay abreast of new innovations. You often ponder: How can we implement novelties in our workflows? For what kind of projects can we suggest AI solutions to our clients? How much time can we save using a specific tool? You are one of the first to pitch ideas.\n\n   We are a young company where the brightest minds work every day on a wide range of clients, such as Beiersdorf, Canva, and smart. We prefer to have the most talented experts on board, but we are also looking for the perfect DEPT®-fit. Someone who is not afraid to learn, inspire, and strive for a better world. Someone who looks ahead, dares to take the stage, and toasts to a successful week with us on Friday afternoon.\n\n   For this role, we're looking for someone who speaks and writes Dutch on a native level.",

            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on content creation, copywriting, and the application of generative AI tools for content generation and workflow improvement. While it mentions prompt engineering and generative AI tools, it lacks the depth in core AI/ML engineering tasks such as model development, MLOps, or building production-grade AI systems that would align with ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer profiles. The emphasis is on using AI as a tool for content marketing and productivity, which fits the definition of the 'Ambiguous' profile for roles primarily focused on the use of AI tools to enhance productivity."
