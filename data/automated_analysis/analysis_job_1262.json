        "rationale": "The provided job advertisement consists solely of the title 'Backend Developer' and contains no descriptive text regarding job tasks, required technologies, or soft skills. As such, it is impossible to classify this role within the scope of the GenAI Engineer Coding Book, which focuses on AI/ML-related responsibilities. The 'Not Relevant' profile is assigned because there is no evidence of tasks from Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering) or Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization) as defined in the coding book."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 1,
        "reasoning": "The job advertisement is extremely brief, containing only a job title. This lack of detail prevents any meaningful analysis against the provided Coding Book, which requires specific phrases and mentions of tasks, technologies, and skills. Therefore, the confidence in the assigned profile is very low."
