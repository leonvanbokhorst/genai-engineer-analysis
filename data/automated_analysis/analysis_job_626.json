            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on traditional full-stack development tasks such as frontend and backend development, API integration, database management, performance optimization, testing, debugging, and security compliance. While it mentions AI model integration, it does not specify generative AI techniques, LLMs, or advanced AI modeling processes. The core responsibilities and technologies listed align more with a general software engineering role rather than a specialized ML or GenAI Engineer role. Therefore, it falls under the 'Ambiguous' category as it's not primarily an AI-focused technical role."
