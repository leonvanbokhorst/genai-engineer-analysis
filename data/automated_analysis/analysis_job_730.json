While generative AI is mentioned as a tool for innovation, the core tasks revolve around managing, developing, and promoting the use of various legal tech tools to improve workflows. There is no indication of deep model development, fine-tuning, or specific prompt engineering tasks. The role acts as a bridge between legal and technology, applying existing or emerging tech to solve business problems, fitting the profile of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

It mentions generative AI but frames it as one of several tools for process improvement. The emphasis is on integration, optimization, and promotion of tools rather than core AI/ML model development. The profile assignment is strongly supported by the text, though a slightly higher score could be achieved with more explicit details on the 'development' aspect of the tools."
