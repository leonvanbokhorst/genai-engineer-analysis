        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the tasks, focusing on system integration and operational support using AI tools. However, it lacks specific details about the AI technologies or models being used, and the 'scripting' mention is broad. This makes it slightly less definitive than a role explicitly detailing model development or GenAI-specific tasks, leading to a high but not perfect confidence score."
