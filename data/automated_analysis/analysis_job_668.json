While it mentions leveraging AI and generative AI, the core responsibilities and technologies listed (Angular, React, React Native, AWS serverless) are primarily software engineering focused. The AI aspects are presented as features to be integrated into products rather than the primary focus of model development or deep AI specialization. Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

The technologies mentioned are standard for full-stack roles. The distinction between building AI-powered products and specializing in AI model development is well-defined by the tasks described."
