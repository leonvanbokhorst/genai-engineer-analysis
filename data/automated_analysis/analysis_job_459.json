            "profile": "Ambiguous",
            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on backend service development and collaboration with research teams to integrate model functionality. While it mentions bringing model functionality to end-users and monitoring production services, it lacks specific details about designing, building, or fine-tuning generative models, RAG systems, or advanced prompt engineering. The core responsibilities lean towards traditional software engineering and operations rather than specialized GenAI development. Therefore, it does not fit the 'GenAI Engineer' profile and is too specific to be 'Ambiguous' based on a lack of AI focus, but it doesn't align with the core technical requirements of 'ML Engineer' or 'GenAI Engineer' as defined in the coding book."
