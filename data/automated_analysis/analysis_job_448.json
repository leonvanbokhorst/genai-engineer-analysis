These tasks fall predominantly under Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration, Operations & MLOps). While the role involves working with LLMs ('Innovate with Large Language Models', 'training and implementation of custom LLMs'), the core responsibility is the engineering and operational platform that supports these GenAI activities, rather than the direct development or specialization in GenAI models themselves. The technical stack also lacks specific LLM frameworks or models, further supporting an engineering-centric role. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile, as it describes a software engineering role that builds or maintains software supporting AI/ML models."
