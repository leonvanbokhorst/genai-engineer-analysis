There are no details about job tasks or responsibilities that would align with any AI/ML or core software engineering roles as defined in the coding book.

This makes it impossible to perform a detailed analysis against the coding book's categories for job tasks or soft skills. The only identifiable elements are technologies, which do not point to an AI/ML role."
