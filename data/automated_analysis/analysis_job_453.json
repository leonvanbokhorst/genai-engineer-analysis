Key responsibilities include creating data pipelines, implementing GCP native ML architectures, working with Vertex AI Search and Conversation API, and writing code to interact with GCP APIs. While Generative AI and LLMs are mentioned, the core tasks lean towards data engineering, ML architecture implementation, and integrating these into cloud solutions, aligning more closely with the 'ML Engineer' profile's emphasis on data-driven models, MLOps, and productionizing systems, rather than the 'GenAI Engineer's' focus on fine-tuning and advanced prompt engineering for user-facing applications."
