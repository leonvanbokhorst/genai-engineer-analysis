While it mentions 'generative AI models' and 'large language models', it does not involve the development, fine-tuning, or deployment of these models themselves, nor does it require traditional ML engineering tasks like algorithm development, data preprocessing for model training, or MLOps. The core activity is human feedback for AI training, which aligns with the 'use of AI tools to enhance productivity' or 'educational' aspects of the Ambiguous profile, rather than a core AI engineering role."
