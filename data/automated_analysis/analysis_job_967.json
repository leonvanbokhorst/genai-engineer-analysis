        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on tasks related to training and evaluating generative AI models, specifically in the context of code generation. While it mentions software engineering expertise is beneficial, the core responsibilities (1.B.1: Model Development & Fine-Tuning) are centered around AI specialization rather than software integration (Macro-Category A). There are no explicit tasks related to building software applications or MLOps. Therefore, 'GenAI Specialist' is the most fitting profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the core tasks related to AI model training and evaluation. However, it lacks specific details about the technologies used or the broader software engineering aspects that would be present in a more integrated role. The emphasis is clearly on the AI specialization part."
