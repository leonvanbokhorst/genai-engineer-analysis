While it mentions 'machine learning methods' and 'data-driven models', the core responsibilities and technologies described align more with traditional data science and engineering roles rather than specialized GenAI engineering. The role is described as 'Senior Data Engineer' and the tasks are centered around extracting value from business data and providing insights, which does not fit the specific requirements of a GenAI Engineer."
