            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on traditional software engineering, architecture, and system reliability for business operations (identity management, billing, subscriptions). While it mentions 'revenue growth objectives' and 'enterprise revenue platforms', there is no explicit mention or strong implication of generative AI, large language models, diffusion models, or related generative AI techniques. The core responsibilities and technologies listed align more with a senior software engineering or platform engineering role rather than a specialized AI/ML role. Therefore, it falls under the 'Ambiguous' category as it's a technical role but not clearly related to AI development as defined in the coding book."
