While it mentions 'Data Science/ML' in the title, the responsibilities described do not involve developing, fine-tuning, or deploying AI/ML models themselves. Instead, the role is about demonstrating a platform's capabilities, advising on architecture, and creating solutions that leverage data analytics, which aligns with a Software Engineer profile that works with data-centric platforms rather than building AI models."

However, the mention of 'Data Science/ML' in the title could be interpreted in multiple ways, but the detailed responsibilities strongly point away from core AI/ML model development and towards software engineering with a data focus. The absence of any mention of GenAI or traditional ML model tasks leads to a high, but not perfect, confidence score."
