        "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on software development and integration tasks within the Salesforce ecosystem (Macro-Category A). While it mentions 'AI-driven solutions', it does not detail specific AI/ML model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG implementation (Macro-Category B). The primary emphasis is on leveraging AI to enhance existing software functionalities and automating processes, fitting the profile of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer who builds or maintains software that uses AI features as a core part of its functionality."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software development and CI/CD tasks. The mention of 'AI-driven solutions' is present but lacks specificity regarding the AI/ML techniques or models involved. This makes it slightly less definitive than a role explicitly detailing GenAI or ML model work, hence a score of 4."
