        "rationale": "The job ad focuses exclusively on tasks related to training and evaluating AI models ('Het maken en beantwoorden van vragen met betrekking tot informatica om AI-modellen te helpen trainen.' and 'Het evalueren en rangschikken van code die door AI-modellen wordt gegenereerd.'). There are no mentions of software development, integration, or MLOps tasks (Macro-Category A). Therefore, the role is predominantly focused on AI specialization, specifically in the context of generative AI model training."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite specific about the tasks involved in training and evaluating AI models. However, it lacks detail on the specific technologies or the exact nature of the 'AI models' being trained (though 'generative AI' is mentioned). The absence of software engineering tasks makes the profile assignment clear, but the lack of technical specifics slightly reduces the confidence."
