There is no mention of AI/ML tasks, models, or specialized tools. The mention of NLP experience is not elaborated upon with specific tasks or technologies, and the core responsibilities described are purely software engineering. Therefore, the 'Software Engineer' profile is the most appropriate."

However, the mention of 'NLP experience' is vague and not tied to specific tasks or technologies, leaving a slight ambiguity about potential AI/ML involvement. If 'NLP experience' was meant to imply AI/ML tasks, the ad does not provide enough detail to classify it as such. The confidence is high for it being a Software Engineer role, but not absolute due to the NLP mention."
