This team focuses on building and standardizing model dev experiences for ML Engineers and Data Scientists. We build and operate the dev tool known as Canvas, where ML engineers can develop the model solutions for their business needs in all critical ML phases, such as feature engineering, training, serving, ML-Ops, and monitoring. With the Canvas tool, users can iterate quickly and collaboratively during model dev time to build their ML solution, and the solution will be automatically scaled up to run robustly when it is deployed into production. Now we are extending our modeling support to generative AI and large scale models. We are looking for talents with experience building and productionize large scaling models solving business problems. This team is formed by a group of talents with various expertise, such as modeling techniques, batch data processing optimization",
