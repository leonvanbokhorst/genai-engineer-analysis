Software Development & Integration and a technology classified under 2.8. Application Frameworks. Crucially, there is no mention of any AI or Machine Learning tasks or technologies, nor any indication of integrating AI/ML into the product. This aligns with the definition of a Software Engineer profile, which involves exclusively tasks from Macro-Category A without AI/ML integration."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 1,
        "reasoning": "The job advertisement is extremely brief, containing only the job title. This provides insufficient detail to perform a thorough analysis of job tasks, technologies, or soft skills beyond the most basic inference from the title itself. The classification and profile assignment are based on minimal information and significant assumptions about what a 'Pega Developer' role typically entails, rather than explicit details within the provided text."
