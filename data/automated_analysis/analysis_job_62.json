It is titled 'Intern - Machine Learning Engineer (LLM)' which suggests a focus on ML and LLMs, but without further information, it is impossible to classify it definitively into ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer. It could also be considered too vague or primarily focused on learning/internship experience rather than core engineering tasks."
