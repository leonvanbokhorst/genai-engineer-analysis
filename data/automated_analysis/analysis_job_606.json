        "rationale": "The job description heavily emphasizes core software engineering tasks such as writing maintainable software, deploying in pipelines and containers, and setting/monitoring programming quality standards (1.A.1, 1.A.2). While it mentions 'Data Science' and 'Machine Learning Engineers', it does not specify any tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). The role focuses on the operationalization and quality of software that likely supports or integrates ML/Data Science efforts, rather than the direct development of AI models themselves. The emphasis on software engineering practices and infrastructure, coupled with a bridging role between different technical teams, points towards an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the software engineering and operational aspects. However, it lacks explicit details about the specific AI/ML models or tasks involved, making it difficult to definitively rule out a more specialized ML role without further context. The absence of any mention of Generative AI specific tasks (LLMs, RAG, etc.) strongly suggests it's not a GenAI role. The focus on software quality and deployment pipelines is clear, but the exact nature of the 'Data Science' being supported is not detailed."
