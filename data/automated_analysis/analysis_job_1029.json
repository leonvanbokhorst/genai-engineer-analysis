Our ideal candidate is an individual who with a solid data science background, has experience in being embedded in software engineering practices while retaining a great amount of product thinking and creative problem-solving. You have a passion for developing cutting-edge solutions that streamline the work of anyone working with data to improve data quality. You will play a crucial role in conducting product research, developing proof of concepts (POCs) for groundbreaking solutions, and working closely with our main engineering team to make these innovations come to life.\n\n   Key Responsibilities\n     * Design and implement full-stack solutions for time-series anomaly detection, generative AI solutions, tabular data classification, and alert prioritization.\n     * Lead the charge in exploring and defining the future of data quality tooling at Soda, focusing on automating mundane tasks to allow for more significant problem-solving opportunities.\n     * Collaborate closely with software engineers and other team members to create seamless, efficient processes and solutions.\n     * Contribute to the product development lifecycle from conception to deployment, ensuring that solutions are scalable, efficient, and meet user needs.\n\n   Detailed Requirements\n\n     * Experience: You should bring at least 3 years of hands-on experience as a Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer, focusing on customer-facing products. This means you've built data products or software intended for external users.\n     * Specialized Knowledge: We're looking for expertise in one or more of the following areas:\n          + time-series modeling and anomaly detection,\n          + classification of tabular data,\n          + creating Generative AI applications.\n          + Your ability to innovate and solve complex problems in these areas is key.\n     * Technology Proficiency: Familiarity with our tech stack is important. We use:\n          + Snowflake Database,\n          + Python,\n          + FastAPI,\n          + OpenAI APIs,\n          + Sklearn,\n          + Streamlit,\n          + Facebook Prophet,\n          + Decision Trees (including Random Forests),\n          + Pytest. Experience with most of these tools will help you hit the ground running.\n     * Problem Solving: At your core, you're a problem solver. You excel at understanding user needs and technical challenges, brainstorming solutions, and learning new methods as necessary. You're comfortable admitting when you don't have all the answers but are confident in your ability to find them.\n     * You love remote work: If you've worked remotely and loved it, you'll fit right in. Our team operates fully remotely with regular meetings in person (offsites every 6 months, and occasional local hangouts), so being effective and engaged in this environment is crucial.\n     * Close Collaboration with Software Engineers: Whether you've been an integral part of a full-stack engineering team or have a solid understanding of cross-disciplinary collaboration, your ability to work alongside front-end, back-end, and platform engineers is vital.\n     * Open to Learning: You're not just focused on data science. You're eager to dive into general software engineering projects and expand your skill set beyond AI and modeling.\n     * Coding and CI/CD: Solid experience with code versioning, continuous integration, and continuous deployment tools, like Git, Github Actions, and Pytest, is expected. You know your way around code reviews and value maintaining high-quality codebases.\n     * Community and Open-Source Minded: One of our products being Open-Source, you'll be interested to engage with and care for the community around the products we offer as part of that channel.\n     * Customer Obsessed: You are not afraid to and show an interest in communicating directly with customers to understand their needs on new and current products (with the help of a product manager). You're also more than willing to provide direct support to customers on products which fall under your scope of expertise.\n\n   Additional Skills\n     * Knowledge of deployment and DevOps tools like Terraform and Kubernetes is a plus.\n     * A proactive approach to product development, contributing ideas and engaging with the product lifecycle.\n     * Openness to taking on leadership roles, mentoring junior data scientists, and contributing to a culture of learning and growth.\n\n   Team Dynamics\n     * A strong team player with a positive attitude, willingness to learn, and a commitment to contributing to a collaborative environment.\n     * High emotional intelligence, with strong interpersonal skills and the ability to work effectively in a remote-first, asynchronous environment.\n     * A deep commitment to diversity and inclusion, ensuring respectful and effective communication across diverse backgrounds and identities.\n\n   Join Us\n\n   At Soda, you'll be part of a forward-thinking team dedicated to innovating the realm of data quality.
