        "Functieomschrijving": "In the telecommunications industry, operational inefficiency and customer dissatisfaction are persistent issues, exacerbated by the complexity and volume of tasks that must be managed manually. Studies show that companies spend up to 30% of their operational budgets on manual task management, often resulting in service downtime and frustrated customers.\n\n   Totogi is revolutionizing this landscape by leveraging cutting-edge, AI-driven systems to automate these tasks, significantly enhancing operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. By integrating advanced AI technology with deep technical expertise, we are not just solving problems reactively but proactively reshaping the entire support process. This approach is exciting because it sets a new standard in customer service efficiency and technical integration, making us a leader in the industry.\n\n   This role is designed for those who thrive in high-tech, innovative environments. It is not a traditional engineering or support role; instead, it combines hands-on technical work with advanced AI tools to proactively optimize and automate complex support tasks. If you excel at scripting, system configuration, and deep technical troubleshooting, and are excited by the prospect of continuously improving processes through technology, this job is for you.\n\n   In this role, you will be a crucial part of our dynamic team, implementing and managing AI-driven systems to enhance operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. You will configure and maintain network functions to ensure seamless service delivery, analyze data to derive actionable insights, and manage incidents to ensure timely resolution. Your work will directly contribute to our strategic decisions and elevate our customer support to new heights. If you are ready to empower your career with advanced AI technology and make a significant impact, we encourage you to apply and join our forward-thinking team.\n\n   What you will be doing\n\n     * AI System Building: Designing and implementing AI-driven systems and monitoring tools to enhance operational efficiency.\n     * Service Configuration and Maintenance: Using AI tools to configure AAA, PCRF, SMSC, and MMSC network functions, ensuring seamless service delivery and customer satisfaction.\n\n   What you will NOT be doing\n\n     * Answering the same questions over and over again\n     * Providing trivial or basic troubleshooting\n     * Writing knowledge base articles, * Enhance operational efficiency and customer satisfaction by optimizing and automating tasks using AI-driven systems and advanced technical skills",
