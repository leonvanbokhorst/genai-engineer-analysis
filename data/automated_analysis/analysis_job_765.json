            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on traditional software development, data engineering (ETL, data processing), and MLOps principles within a banking context (Credit Risk). While it mentions 'big data' and 'calculations', there is no mention of machine learning, generative AI, predictive modeling, or specific AI/ML frameworks or models. The core responsibilities and technologies (Java, Oracle, Linux, Kafka, Azure DevOps) point towards a senior software/data engineer role rather than an ML or GenAI Engineer. Therefore, it falls under the 'Ambiguous' category as it's a technical role but not specifically AI/ML or GenAI focused."
