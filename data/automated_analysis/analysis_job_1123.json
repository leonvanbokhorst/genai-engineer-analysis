While it involves AI, the core tasks are about application support, ticket analysis, and providing feedback for AI improvement, which aligns more with using AI tools to enhance productivity rather than core AI engineering roles like ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer. The emphasis is on 'application support' and 'customer resolutions' using AI, not on building the AI itself."
