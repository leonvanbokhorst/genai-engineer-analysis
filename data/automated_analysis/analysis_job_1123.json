While there's an element of model improvement (1.B.1), the primary emphasis is on applying and integrating AI to enhance an existing application (customer support), rather than developing AI models from scratch or specializing purely in GenAI tasks. The tasks are predominantly in Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration) with supporting tasks in AI Specialization, making 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' the most fitting profile."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to AI integration and improvement within a support context. While it mentions AI model fine-tuning, the overall framing suggests a role that leverages and enhances existing AI systems rather than deep AI research or development. The soft skills are also clearly implied. The confidence is high, but not perfect, as the 'AI-Augmented Customer Resolutions' could be interpreted with slightly more depth in AI model improvement than explicitly stated."
