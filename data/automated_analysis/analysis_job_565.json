It also includes developing 'end-to-end solutions' and 'robust solutions that are used in production' (1.A.1, 1.A.2), indicating a blend of software engineering and ML operations. The role aims to create 'real impact' and generate 'business value' (1.C.1), aligning with the 'Core ML Engineer' profile which requires a balance of Macro-Category A and B tasks focused on traditional ML. The mention of 'generative AI' in a question suggests awareness but not a primary focus on GenAI tasks."

The mention of generative AI is in the context of a question about its ethical deployment, not as a core task. This makes the classification as 'Core ML Engineer' highly probable, but not absolutely definitive without more explicit GenAI-focused tasks."
