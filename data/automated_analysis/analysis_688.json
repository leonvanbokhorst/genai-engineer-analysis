However, it explicitly states 'Coding or programming' will NOT be done and focuses on client interaction, business analysis, and configuration rather than the development, fine-tuning, or productionization of AI models themselves. This aligns more with a business or consulting role leveraging AI, rather than a technical GenAI Engineer profile."
