            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on DevOps tasks such as infrastructure management, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment automation, which are core to Operations Engineering (TASK5). However, it lacks specific details about AI model development, training, or the application of generative AI techniques. While it mentions 'AI applications', it does not specify the nature of these applications or the engineer's role in their creation beyond deployment and infrastructure. The emphasis is on the operational aspects of AI systems rather than the AI development itself, making it lean towards a traditional DevOps role with an AI context, rather than a specialized AI engineering role."
