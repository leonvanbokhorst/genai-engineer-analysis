While it mentions research and prototyping, there is no explicit mention of AI, machine learning, generative models, or related technologies. The responsibilities align with general software development rather than specialized AI roles like ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer. Therefore, it falls under the 'Ambiguous' category as it is not an AI-specific technical role."
