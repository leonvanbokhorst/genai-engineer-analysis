While it mentions designing AI tools, the emphasis is on tailoring them for customer service and reporting on their integration, which aligns more with using AI to improve existing processes rather than building AI systems from the ground up. The responsibilities lean towards business understanding and operational improvement through AI, rather than deep technical AI engineering."
