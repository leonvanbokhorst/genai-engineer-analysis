While it mentions business process automation (1.C.1), the core task is centered around generative AI (1.B.2). There are no explicit mentions of traditional software engineering tasks (Macro-Category A). Therefore, the role is best classified as a GenAI Specialist."

        "score": 3,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is very brief and lacks specific details about the day-to-day tasks or required technical skills beyond mentioning 'generative AI' and 'ChatGPT'. This makes it difficult to definitively assign a profile with high confidence, as it could lean towards development or pure specialization depending on unstated responsibilities."
