        "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on integrating AI capabilities into customer resolution systems and improving existing AI models through feedback and fine-tuning (Macro-Category A tasks like 'Software Development & Integration' and 'AI-Augmented Customer Resolutions'). While there are mentions of 'AI model fine-tuning sessions' and 'prototyping new AI tools', these are in service of improving the overall support system rather than core AI model development or research. The role is about applying AI to solve business problems within a support context, making it an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer role."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to integrating AI and improving AI systems within a customer support context. The tasks lean towards application rather than deep AI research or model building. The 'What you will NOT be doing' section also provides context. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the term 'fine-tuning' could sometimes imply deeper ML work, but in this context, it seems to be about improving the AI's performance in a specific application."
