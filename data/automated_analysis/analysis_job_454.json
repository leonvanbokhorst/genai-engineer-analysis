There is no mention of Generative AI specific tasks like LLMs, RAG, or prompt engineering. The emphasis on 'predictieve modellen' and the specific examples provided clearly place this role within the traditional ML domain, with a strong software engineering component for deployment and operations."

The distinction between traditional ML and GenAI is evident, and the responsibilities clearly align with a Core ML Engineer profile. The mention of specific tasks like building data pipelines, MLOps, and web applications alongside model development solidifies this classification."
