            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on DevOps and infrastructure management (CI/CD, Azure, Kubernetes, Terraform, Prometheus, Grafana) and mentions scaling LLM applications as a task. However, it lacks specific details about core generative AI development, fine-tuning, or advanced prompt engineering, which are central to the GenAI Engineer profile. While it involves AI infrastructure, the primary focus remains on the operational and engineering aspects rather than the AI model development itself, making it lean towards a traditional infrastructure/DevOps role with an AI component, or potentially an ML Engineer role if the 'scaling LLM applications' implied deeper model integration. Given the strong emphasis on infrastructure and the absence of core AI modeling tasks, 'Ambiguous' is the most appropriate classification as it doesn't fit neatly into the defined ML or GenAI Engineer profiles."
