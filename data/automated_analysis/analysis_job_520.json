            "rationale": "The job description focuses on 'Intelligent Automation' and 'Robotic Engineering' using tools like UiPath, AI, and Machine Learning, but it lacks the specific depth and focus on generative models, LLMs, or core ML model development required for an ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer. The primary tasks involve monitoring, fixing issues, and collaborating with business leaders on automation processes, which aligns more with business process automation than specialized AI engineering roles. The role is more about the application and maintenance of existing automation tools rather than the research, development, or fine-tuning of advanced AI models."
