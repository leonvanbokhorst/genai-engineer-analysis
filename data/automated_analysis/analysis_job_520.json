While 'generative AI' is mentioned in the context of the overall R&D process, the specific tasks described for the engineer do not involve direct model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. The role is about building the software infrastructure that supports and integrates with AI/ML operations, rather than developing the AI models themselves. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering responsibilities and mentions the integration of ML Ops, but it does not detail specific GenAI model development tasks. The mention of 'generative AI' is in a broader context of the R&D process rather than a core responsibility for this specific role. This makes the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile a strong fit, but a slightly lower confidence score is given because the exact nature of the 'use of generative AI' is not elaborated upon for this specific engineer's tasks."
