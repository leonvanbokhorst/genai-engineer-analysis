While it mentions AI and NLP technologies and integrating ML models, the core responsibilities and the title 'Full Stack Developer' indicate that the role is about building and maintaining the software application that *uses* AI, rather than developing or specializing in the AI models themselves. There are no explicit tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG systems (Macro-Category B). Therefore, the profile 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting, as it involves building software that directly integrates AI features."

While AI is mentioned as a component, the core duties are firmly rooted in software engineering. The technologies listed are also standard for full-stack development. This clarity makes the analysis straightforward and highly confident."
