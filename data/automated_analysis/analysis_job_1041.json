        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on tasks related to AI/ML, specifically working with data to infer issues, leveraging LLMs for understanding requests, and prototyping ML models. While it mentions 'Applied AI Integration' in the title, the described tasks are predominantly centered around the AI/ML model development and data analysis aspects (Macro-Category B) rather than the integration into a larger software product (Macro-Category A). There are no explicit software engineering tasks mentioned. Therefore, it aligns best with an ML Specialist (Data Scientist) profile, with a focus on the ML/AI aspects."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines tasks related to AI/ML model prototyping and data analysis, including the use of LLMs. However, it is an internship description, and the 'integration' aspect mentioned in the title is not elaborated upon with specific software engineering tasks. The focus is clearly on the AI/ML side, making the profile assignment relatively straightforward, but the lack of explicit software engineering tasks prevents a perfect score."
