It explicitly mentions tasks such as advanced prompt engineering, fine-tuning (implied by 'optimization' and 'training'), and building systems around these models, aligning directly with the core responsibilities and typical projects of a GenAI Engineer. While 'ML Engineer' is mentioned in the title, the detailed responsibilities and technologies point more towards generative AI applications rather than traditional predictive modeling."
