While it involves software development and MLOps principles for quality assurance, the core emphasis is on ensuring the quality of GenAI applications rather than building them from scratch or focusing on predictive modeling. The role requires understanding and testing generative models, aligning with the 'GenAI Engineer' profile's focus on developing and deploying applications built on top of generative models, albeit from a quality assurance perspective."
