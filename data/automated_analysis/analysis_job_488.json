While it mentions Generative AI, LLM technologies, DialogFlow, and Vertex AI (indicating AI specialization), the primary focus is on implementing, productionalizing, and integrating these technologies within a cloud environment, rather than deep model development or specialized GenAI research. The tasks lean more towards building and managing the systems that *use* AI rather than developing the AI models themselves."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities and technologies. The classification is straightforward, but the profile assignment requires careful consideration of the balance between software engineering and AI specialization. It's not ambiguous, but a slightly higher score would require more explicit detail on the *depth* of AI involvement versus cloud engineering."
