            "profile": "Ambiguous",
            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on cloud infrastructure, deployment, and data pipelines within Google Cloud Platform (GCP), mentioning technologies like Terraform and Azure DevOps (though the role specifies GCP). While it mentions Generative AI and LLMs, the core responsibilities and technologies listed (GCP, DialogFlow, Looker, BigQuery, Vertex AI) point towards a Cloud Engineer role focused on operationalizing AI solutions rather than developing or fine-tuning the AI models themselves. The emphasis is on infrastructure and deployment, not on core AI model development or advanced prompt engineering, which are central to a GenAI Engineer profile. It also lacks the depth of ML-specific tasks required for an ML Engineer. Therefore, it falls under 'Ambiguous' as it's a technical role but not directly fitting the core definitions of ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer as per the coding book, leaning more towards infrastructure and operationalization of AI services."
