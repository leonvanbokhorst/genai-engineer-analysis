In this role, you will build the most important features of a product, all while shaping its technical direction and ensuring long-term stability and growth. Your technical decisions will directly impact the product and its users, giving you the autonomy to innovate and the responsibility to deliver.\n\n   You'll work on products that are transforming learning:\n     * TeachTap: Leverages AI to bring historical figures to life in a TikTok-like learning experience.\n     * TeachTales: Engages students with personalized, magical storytelling that boosts comprehension.\n     * TimeBack: Acts as a learning copilot that integrates with existing apps, proactively coaching students.\n     * Athena: Uses AI-generated videos and tests to deliver measurable academic outcomes.\n\n   You will drive the technical evolution of our products, ensuring they are scalable, maintainable, and robust for the long term. Collaborating closely with product teams, you will translate high-level requirements into technical design choices and solve complex challenges while maintaining high-quality standards. Your decisions will shape the product's future and influence how thousands of students learn and grow.\n\n   We prioritize thoughtful planning and up-front design. Our AI-first approach automates mundane tasks, freeing you to focus on high-impact decisions and problem-solving. You will have a high degree of autonomy and the ability to influence product direction and prioritize long-term stability and scalability.\n\n   If you're ready to lead the technical evolution of our SaaS products and leverage generative AI to push boundaries, we'd love to hear from you.\n\n   What you will be doing\n\n     * Feature Development: Designing and implementing new features focusing on scalability, maintainability, and long-term product impact.\n     * Requirement Engineering: Collaborating with the product team to refine requirements and leading technical discussions to align features with product goals.\n     * Operations and Maintenance: Monitoring and maintaining product stability, tuning performance, and proactively identifying and resolving issues.\n     * Technical Design: Making stakes technical decisions directly impacting user experiences and product scalability.\n\n   What you will NOT be doing\n\n     * Switching between short-term projects or chasing the next hype-driven technology trend.\n     * Working on internal IT systems or outsourced projects without real-world user impact.\n     * Getting stuck in endless meetings or dealing with tedious infrastructure issues.",
