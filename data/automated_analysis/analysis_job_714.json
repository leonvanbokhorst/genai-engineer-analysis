While there's an element of AI model improvement (1.B.1), the primary emphasis is on applying and integrating these AI capabilities into a customer-facing support system (1.A.1). The role is not primarily about developing AI models from scratch or specializing deeply in GenAI techniques but rather using AI to augment existing support functions. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile as it involves building or maintaining software that uses AI features as a core part of its functionality, with the output being an AI-augmented support system."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to AI integration and improvement within a customer support context. The tasks are specific enough to map to the coding book categories. However, the ad is relatively brief and doesn't go into deep technical detail about the AI models or specific software development practices, which prevents a perfect score."
