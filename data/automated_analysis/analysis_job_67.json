    "profile": {
        "assigned_profile": "Core ML Engineer",
        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on the design and development of ML/AI-based algorithms for patient monitoring and risk prediction. While it mentions 'generative AI' as a technology, the core tasks described (algorithm development, vital signs analysis, risk prediction) are more aligned with traditional ML rather than the specific applications of LLMs or diffusion models that define GenAI roles. The role also includes project management responsibilities, indicating a blend of technical development and strategic oversight. It does not appear to be a purely software engineering role integrating AI, nor a specialist role focused solely on model building without project management. Therefore, 'Core ML Engineer' is the most fitting profile, with a strong emphasis on the 'B' category (Model Development & Fine-Tuning) and some 'Business Understanding & Strategy' tasks."
    },
    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to algorithm development and project management. The mention of 'generative AI' is present, but the primary focus seems to be on traditional ML applications in healthcare. The confidence is high, but not perfect (5), because the emphasis on 'generative AI' could imply a broader scope than just traditional ML, making the distinction between 'Core ML Engineer' and potentially 'Core GenAI Engineer' slightly nuanced without more specific details on the generative AI applications."
