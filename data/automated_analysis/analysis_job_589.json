While it mentions leveraging 'AI models and algorithms' to transform threat defense, the primary emphasis is on building and integrating these AI capabilities into a broader security platform. There is no indication of deep specialization in model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. Therefore, the role is classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, where AI is a component of the software being built."

The role of AI is described as a feature to be integrated and leveraged within this platform, rather than the primary focus of deep specialization. The distinction between building an AI-powered platform (AI-Adjacent Software Engineer) and specializing in AI model development (GenAI Specialist or Core GenAI Engineer) is well-defined by the text."
