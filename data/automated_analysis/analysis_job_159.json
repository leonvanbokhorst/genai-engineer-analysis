While it mentions 'GenAI' as a future roadmap item, the core responsibilities and required skills described do not align with a specialized GenAI Engineer role. The emphasis is on building and scaling backend services, leading development teams, and maintaining existing infrastructure, which fits more within a general Senior Backend or DevOps Engineer profile. The mention of GenAI is aspirational rather than a current, central requirement of the role."
