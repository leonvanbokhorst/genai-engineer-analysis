        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on software development and integration tasks (Macro-Category A), such as creating, troubleshooting, maintaining, and updating platforms, testing and integrating AI technologies, and ensuring support across infrastructures. While LLMs and GPT-4 Vision are mentioned (indicating AI specialization), the primary emphasis is on building and maintaining the software systems that *use* these technologies, rather than deep model development or research. The role involves integrating AI into existing workflows and providing support, fitting the description of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering responsibilities alongside the integration of AI technologies. The tasks are well-defined, and the mention of specific AI tools like LLMs and GPT-4 Vision helps in classification. However, it's not a perfect 5 because the depth of AI specialization (e.g., model training, research) is not extensively detailed, making the distinction between 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' and a 'Core GenAI Engineer' slightly less sharp, though the former seems more fitting based on the provided text."
