While it mentions 'generative AI tech' and 'AI-driven automation', the core responsibilities are centered around software development and integration (Macro-Category A), with AI being a feature or tool within that development process, rather than the primary focus of model development or specialization (Macro-Category B). The role is about creating AI-powered applications, making it an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines a software engineering role that integrates AI. The emphasis is on building and shipping applications, owning the product lifecycle, and weaving AI into front-end and back-end experiences. While it mentions generative AI, the core tasks are firmly rooted in software development. The distinction between AI-Adjacent Software Engineer and Core GenAI Engineer is clear based on the description. A slightly lower score is given because the specific generative AI tasks are described more broadly ('integrating the latest generative AI tech') rather than detailing specific model development or fine-tuning activities."
