Do you thrive in environments where excellence is the norm, dissecting and designing with a level of precision that only the keenest eye can achieve?\n\n   We're scouting for an expert in psychometrics with a flair for distilling complex educational measurements into clear, effective tests to sculpt revolutionary educational experiences. Think you have checked all the right boxes so far? Then this is your opportunity to shine.\n\n   At 2 Hour Learning, we're not just tinkering with the idea of AI in education; we're orchestrating a full-blown transformation. Scrap the old playbook of manual test creation. Textbooks? Obsolete. In this role, you will wield the power of generative AI to design prompts that delve deep into the subject matter, commanding it to produce test content that's personalized, engaging, and rigorous.\n\n   Your experience in quantitative measurement and educational content creation will help you synthesize complex frameworks into AI prompts, yielding razor-sharp test questions that align tightly with educational standards. You will then quality control your outputs by crafting AI-first rubrics, ensuring each question and answer hits the mark and stimulates curiosity, enriching the learning journey. It's all about a relentless pursuit of excellence, a continuous cycle of refinement, and a dedication to content that not only meets but exceeds the bar.\n\n   If you're seeking a role where you can blend creativity with technology and where your contributions have a lasting impact, 2 Hour Learning is where you belong.

While it mentions generative AI and specific tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude, the core responsibilities revolve around using these tools for psychometric and educational content development, not building or engineering AI systems. The explicit statement 'Developing code to automate systems - you will focus on test design using AI, while our engineers handle the tech specifics' further reinforces that this is not a core AI engineering role."
