        "rationale": "The job advertisement provided is extremely brief, containing only the title 'Software Engineer' and no descriptive text regarding responsibilities, required skills, or technologies. Based solely on the title, the most direct interpretation is a traditional software engineering role. Therefore, the 'Software Engineer' profile is assigned, assuming the role does not involve specific AI/ML integration. This assignment is made with extremely low confidence due to the complete lack of descriptive information."

        "reasoning": "The job advertisement is exceptionally minimal, providing only the title 'Software Engineer' and no further details. This prevents any meaningful analysis of tasks, technologies, or soft skills, making the profile assignment highly speculative and the overall analysis unreliable."
