            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on DevOps practices within the Microsoft 365 ecosystem, including application lifecycle management, codebase scalability, and team collaboration. While it mentions exploring 'generative AI' and 'adaptive cards', these are presented as future possibilities rather than core responsibilities. The primary focus remains on traditional DevOps engineering and platform enhancement within Microsoft technologies, not on the development, fine-tuning, or deployment of generative AI models themselves. Therefore, it does not align with the core responsibilities of an ML Engineer or a GenAI Engineer."
