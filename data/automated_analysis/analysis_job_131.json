            "rationale": "The job description emphasizes research into deep learning and natural language processing techniques to improve a dialog system. While it mentions improving quality, performance, latency, throughput, and efficiency of models, and creating products used by millions, the core focus on 'researching latest techniques and methods' and 'improving the dialog system' aligns more with the predictive modeling and algorithm development aspects of an ML Engineer, rather than the direct application development and fine-tuning of LLMs characteristic of a GenAI Engineer. The phrase 'dialog system' can be a component of GenAI, but the overall description leans towards foundational model improvement and application rather than the core generative aspects."
