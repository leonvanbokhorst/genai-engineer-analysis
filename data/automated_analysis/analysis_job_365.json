Industry 4.0 (i4.0) addresses these challenges by leveraging IT solutions and connectivity to access, process and use data that is being generated in manufacturing. To speed-up our research in i4.0 we have built a configurable production line simulator. This simulator generates realistic data for experimentation with international standards and new technology (e.g. generative AI). To build these experiments we need to configure several simulation artifacts, define test scenarios and provide a low-code environment for integrating 3rd party software.\n       What will be your role?\n       This assignment is about building a user-friendly and attractive user interface for the existing simulator.\n       An indication of tasks for the assignment:\n          + Learn about Industry 4.0 and the manufacturing domain\n          + Investigate & evaluate concepts and solutions for defining experiments and low-code integration of 3rd party software\n          + Design and implement the chosen solution in the user-interface\n          + Design and implement extensions for the backend, e.g. REST and websocket interfaces\n          + Write unit and integration tests\n          + Evaluate user experience (UX)\n          + To elicit the right design requirements and validate your work, you will work with data scientists and a production engineer from one of our clients on building a simulation of a real production line. If any simulation capabilities are missing, either you or another team member will implement those.\n       The current technology stack consists of:\n          + Frontend: Svelte + Typescript\n          + Backend: Python (FastAPI)\n          + CI/CD: Docker, Gitlab CI, unit tests\n       You will join our team of experienced developers, working closely to collaborate and share expertise.\n       The assignment will mainly take place at TNO, but we will visit some of our partner manufacturing sites for introduction, experimentation and validation.\n       What we expect from you\n          + You are a HBO student ICT, Informatica or related and looking for a graduation assignment of 6-9 months.\n          + You have an interest in the challenges that come with discrete simulation and software development, especially frontend / user-interface development.\n          + You have a do-er mindset and like working in a multi-disciplinary environment.\n       What you'll get in return\n       You want an internship opportunity on the precursor of your career; an internship gives you an opportunity to take a good look at your prospective future employer. TNO goes a step further. It's not just looking that interests us; you and your knowledge are essential to our innovation. That's why we attach a great deal of value to your personal and professional development. You will, of course, be properly supervised during your work placement and be given the scope for you to get the best out of yourself. Furthermore, we provide:\n          + A highly professional, innovative internship environment, within a team of top experts.\n          + A suitable internship allowance (615 euro for wo-, hbo- and mbo-students, for a full-time internship).\n          + Possibility of eight hours of free leave per internship month (for a full-time internship).\n          + A free membership of Jong TNO , where you can meet other TNO professionals and join several activities , such as sports activities, (work-related) courses or the yearly ski-trip.\n          + Use of a laptop.\n          + An allowance for travel expenses in case you don't receive an OV-card.\n       TNO as an employer\n       At TNO, we innovate for a healthier, safer and more sustainable life.
