While it mentions 'Generative AI (GenAI) services' and 'AI technologies', it does not detail specific tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). The focus is on building the platform and services that *leverage* AI, rather than the AI models themselves. Therefore, the role is classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, as it primarily involves software engineering with AI as a component of the product."
