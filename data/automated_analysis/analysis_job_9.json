The tasks described, such as designing, developing, testing, and providing technical support for web applications, fall under traditional software engineering and do not align with the core responsibilities of an ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer as defined in the coding book. The mention of 'staying up to date with the latest trends' is too general to indicate a focus on AI."
