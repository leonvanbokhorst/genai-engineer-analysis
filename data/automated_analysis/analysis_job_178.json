        "rationale": "The job ad heavily emphasizes traditional software engineering tasks (1.A.1) such as developing production-grade ML systems, writing readable/reusable code, choosing technologies, and evaluating architectures. It also includes significant MLOps/operations responsibilities (1.A.2) like end-to-end ownership, monitoring, data governance, and SLOs. While it mentions 'ML/AI' and 'GENAI Studio', there are no specific tasks or technologies related to Generative AI (like LLMs, RAG, prompt engineering). The mention of 'ML/AI' in the context of 'keeping up to date' and 'internal ML programs' suggests a focus on the broader ML field rather than a specific specialization in GenAI. Therefore, the role is classified as a Core ML Engineer due to the strong emphasis on traditional ML system development and operations without specific GenAI tasks."
    },
    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite detailed regarding the engineering and operational aspects of ML systems. However, the specific mention of 'GENAI Studio' in the title creates a slight ambiguity. While the responsibilities described are predominantly traditional ML engineering, the title might imply a GenAI focus that isn't explicitly detailed in the tasks. The absence of any GenAI-specific tasks or technologies leads to a strong leaning towards 'Core ML Engineer', but the title prevents a perfect score."
