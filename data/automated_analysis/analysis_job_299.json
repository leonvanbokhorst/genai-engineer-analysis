The core tasks described are more aligned with human feedback for AI training rather than engineering AI systems. There is a lack of evidence for core AI engineering tasks like model development, MLOps, or advanced software development for AI applications, making it fall under the 'Ambiguous' category as it primarily focuses on the use of AI tools for a specific task (code generation evaluation) rather than AI development."
