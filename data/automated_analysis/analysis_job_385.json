            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on front-end development using Vue.js and general web technologies, with a mention of GenAI as a focus area for initiatives. However, it lacks specific details about core GenAI engineering tasks such as fine-tuning models, building RAG systems, or advanced prompt engineering. The primary responsibilities and technologies listed are more aligned with traditional front-end development, making it difficult to classify as a dedicated GenAI Engineer or ML Engineer role. It leans towards using AI tools rather than building core AI systems."
