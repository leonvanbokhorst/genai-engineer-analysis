            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on traditional data engineering tasks such as designing, building, and optimizing data pipelines, data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation. While it mentions collaboration with data scientists and the development of data models for machine learning, it does not detail specific involvement in building, fine-tuning, or deploying generative AI models, nor does it emphasize advanced prompt engineering, RAG systems, or PEFT. The core responsibilities and technologies described align more with a Data Engineer role rather than a GenAI Engineer or ML Engineer, and the role is not primarily focused on AI model development itself. Therefore, it falls under the 'Ambiguous' category as it's a technical role but not specifically an AI/ML engineering role as defined in the Coding Book."
