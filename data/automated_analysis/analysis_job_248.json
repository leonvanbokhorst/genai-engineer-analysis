We are seeking a Backend Engineer with some knowledge of DevOps (or a willingness to learn) to join our talented team. You will play a crucial role in building, scaling and maintaining our backend infrastructure that is used to serve our AI capabilities while contributing to product development, including launching new features and services from scratch. You are sure to be challenged with exciting challenges on a daily basis.\n\n   At Engaige we are building the platform that enables businesses to build, maintain and grow individually-tailored relationships with their customers efficiently at scale. Our platform centralizes all company specific information, ranging from general information and real-time customer data to company policies, while providing full visibility and control over AI decision-making. This approach enables businesses to deploy highly capable AI agents reliably, creating a new standard in customer experience.\n\n   What You'll Do:\n     * Build from scratch: Contribute to the development of new features and products. Bring your ideas and those of your team to life by designing and implementing backend services that drive our platform forward.\n     * Architect & optimize: Help scale our architecture, including cloud-based services, REST APIs, and logging frameworks, ensuring high performance and reliability as we grow across multiple regions and workloads.\n     * DevOps integration: Be hands-on with our DevOps setup, streamlining deployments, monitoring systems, and optimizing infrastructure for reliability and efficiency using cloud-based tools and CI/CD workflows.\n     * Collaborate on technical roadmaps: Participate in designing the technical roadmap, working closely with the CTO and other engineers to shape the future of our product and backend ecosystem.\n     * Security and monitoring: Ensure our systems are secure and robust by integrating monitoring and security tools, maintaining CI/CD pipelines, and implementing best practices for system reliability.\n\n   Tech Stack You'll Be Working With:\n     * Cloud platforms and deployment tools\n     * FastAPI, React\n     * Database technologies (e.g., PostgreSQL, Redis)\n     * LLM providers\n     * Monitoring and CI/CD tools (e.g., GitHub Actions, CodeCov)\n     * REST APIs, Webhooks",

The core responsibilities are centered around traditional backend development, scaling infrastructure, and DevOps, rather than specialized GenAI engineering tasks. Therefore, it falls under the 'Ambiguous' category as it's not a clear-cut AI/ML role, but rather a backend role that *uses* AI capabilities."
