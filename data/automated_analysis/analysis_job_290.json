            "profile": "Ambiguous",
            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on data engineering, data pipelines, architecture, and coaching junior colleagues. While it mentions driving success of data engineering and enabling data-driven decision-making, it lacks specific details about building, fine-tuning, or deploying generative AI models, RAG systems, or advanced prompt engineering, which are core to the GenAI Engineer profile. It also doesn't emphasize predictive modeling or MLOps in the context of ML models as much as a dedicated ML Engineer would. The role appears to be a senior data engineering position with some architectural responsibilities, rather than a specialized AI engineering role."
