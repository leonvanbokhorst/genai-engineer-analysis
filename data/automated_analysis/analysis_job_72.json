            "profile": "Ambiguous",
            "rationale": "The job description focuses on leveraging Microsoft's AI offerings and collaborating with customer engineering teams to build solutions. While it mentions AI and ML Ops, it lacks specific details on core generative AI tasks like fine-tuning LLMs, RAG systems, or advanced prompt engineering. The role seems more focused on integrating existing AI services and platforms rather than developing novel generative AI models or applications from scratch, leaning towards a more generalized AI platform engineering or consulting role, which doesn't fit the specific definitions of ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer. It also emphasizes using AI tools to enhance productivity and solve customer challenges, which aligns with the 'Ambiguous' category's focus on the use of AI tools for productivity."
