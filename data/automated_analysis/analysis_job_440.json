            "profile": "Ambiguous",
            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on the use of AI as a tool to enhance existing software development processes and productivity, rather than on the development, fine-tuning, or deployment of AI models themselves. Phrases like 'AI as their co-pilot', 'elevating your coding skills', 'crafting AI tools that clarify complex concepts', and 'AI as a booster, not a replacement' indicate a focus on AI-assisted development rather than core AI engineering. There is no mention of specific AI models, generative techniques, RAG, fine-tuning, or MLOps, which are hallmarks of GenAI or ML Engineer roles. The role seems more aligned with leveraging AI for productivity gains in traditional software engineering, fitting the 'Ambiguous' profile's criteria for roles primarily focused on the use of AI tools."
