While it mentions using cutting-edge AI tools like GPT-4 Vision, the primary emphasis is on the engineering and integration of these AI capabilities into functional systems, rather than deep model development or research (minimal Macro-Category B tasks). The statement 'our AI is your trusty sidekick, handling the grunt work while you focus on the big picture and groundbreaking ideas' suggests AI is a tool for the engineer, not the sole focus of their technical depth. The role builds software that directly uses AI models as a core part of its functionality, producing an AI-powered system, aligning with the definition of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite descriptive about the outcomes and purpose of the role (AI-powered automations, reinvention, optimization) and clearly states what the role is not doing (traditional coding). The use of specific GenAI tools helps anchor it. However, the 'balanced mix' requirement for 'Core GenAI Engineer' is not met by the explicit task coding, making the distinction between 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' and 'Core GenAI Engineer' slightly nuanced. The 'Software Engineer' title and the 'AI is your sidekick' phrasing lean towards AI-Adjacent."
