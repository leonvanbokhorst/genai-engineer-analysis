            "rationale": "The job description focuses on integrating GenAI capabilities into an existing Pega platform for case management, rather than developing core GenAI models or applications from scratch. While it mentions 'GenAI capabilities' and 'AI-driven case management solutions', it lacks specific details on advanced GenAI techniques like fine-tuning LLMs, RAG system development, or complex agent building. The primary emphasis is on Pega development with an AI overlay, and the role seems to be more about applying existing AI tools within a specific business context (financial crime prevention) rather than being a dedicated GenAI engineering role. The core responsibilities lean towards application development and integration within the Pega ecosystem, with AI being a feature rather than the central focus of development."
