These are predominantly tasks from Macro-Category B, specifically 1.B.1 (Model Development & Fine-Tuning), with no mention of core software engineering tasks (Macro-Category A).

However, it lacks specific details about the technologies used or the depth of the software engineering aspects, which prevents a perfect score. The focus is clearly on the AI specialization part."
