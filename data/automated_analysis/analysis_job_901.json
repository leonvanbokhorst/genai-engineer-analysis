While it mentions AI and data systems, it does not specify tasks related to core model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. The emphasis is on the engineering and application of these systems within a business context (e-commerce, digital marketing), aligning with Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering) tasks, specifically Data Engineering & Management and Business Understanding & Strategy. There are no explicit mentions of traditional ML or GenAI model building tasks (Macro-Category B). Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is reasonably clear about the responsibilities, focusing on the application and integration of AI/data systems within a business context. However, it lacks specific details about the AI/ML techniques or models involved, making it slightly less definitive than a highly technical description. The profile assignment is based on the described tasks rather than specific technologies."
