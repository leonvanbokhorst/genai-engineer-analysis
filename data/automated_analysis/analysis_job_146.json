            "rationale": "The job description focuses on developing and maintaining the Apache CloudStack software, which is a cloud orchestrator. While it involves software development and operational support, it does not align with the core responsibilities or technologies of an ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer as defined in the Coding Book. The role is primarily traditional software development and infrastructure management within a cloud environment, rather than AI/ML model development or deployment. Therefore, it falls under the 'Ambiguous' category as it is not an AI-specific technical role."
