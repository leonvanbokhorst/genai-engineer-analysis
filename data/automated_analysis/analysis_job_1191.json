            "rationale": "The job description focuses on exam development, localization, and maintenance, with a secondary mention of integrating generative AI solutions. While there's a mention of 'machine learning algorithms' and 'test analysis', the core responsibilities and the overall emphasis of the role are not centered around AI/ML engineering tasks like model development, deployment, or MLOps. The primary focus is on educational product development and quality assurance, with AI integration being a supporting activity rather than the main function. Therefore, it does not fit the 'ML Engineer' or 'GenAI Engineer' profiles."
