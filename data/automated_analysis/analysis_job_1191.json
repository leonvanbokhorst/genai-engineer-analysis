        "rationale": "The job advertisement focuses entirely on backend software engineering tasks, such as designing, implementing, and maintaining systems, integrating features, and ensuring reliability. While it mentions 'advanced bot detection and fraud prevention technologies,' the core responsibility is the integration and maintenance of these systems within the backend, not the development or fine-tuning of AI models themselves. The technologies listed are primarily software development and MLOps tools, with no specific mention of LLMs, GenAI frameworks, or traditional ML model development tasks. Therefore, the role is classified as a Software Engineer."

All tasks described fall squarely within traditional software engineering, with no indication of AI/ML model development or specialization. The technologies listed are also standard backend and MLOps tools. This clarity makes the classification straightforward and highly confident."
