            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on cloud infrastructure, deployment, and operationalization using tools like Terraform and Azure DevOps (though GCP is the primary cloud platform mentioned in the role). While it mentions Generative AI and LLMs, the core responsibilities and technologies listed (GCP, DialogFlow, Vertex AI Search, Looker, BigQuery) point towards a Cloud Engineer role that *supports* AI products rather than developing or deeply engineering the AI models themselves. The emphasis is on infrastructure, pipelines, and operationalizing existing AI services, not on core AI model development, fine-tuning, or advanced prompt engineering which are hallmarks of a GenAI Engineer. The role also lacks the deep ML modeling aspects of an ML Engineer. Therefore, it falls into the 'Ambiguous' category as it's primarily a cloud infrastructure role with AI product integration, rather than a core AI development role."
