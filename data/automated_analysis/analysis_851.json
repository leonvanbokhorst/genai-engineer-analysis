However, the core responsibilities heavily emphasize traditional software development (TASK4) and business understanding (TASK1), with a weaker direct connection to specialized GenAI tasks like fine-tuning or advanced RAG systems. The evidence leans more towards a software engineering role that *may* engage with GenAI, rather than a dedicated GenAI specialist."
