        "assigned_profile": "AI-Adjacent Software Engineer",
        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on developing and managing integrations between various systems, including AI/LLM, using tools like RPA and IPaaS. While AI/LLM is mentioned, the core tasks are about integrating existing systems and automating workflows, rather than developing or fine-tuning AI models themselves. The role also involves advising on future developments and consulting with business partners. This aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile, where the primary focus is on software engineering tasks (integration, automation) that incorporate AI/LLM components."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the core responsibilities related to integration and automation, and mentions AI/LLM as one of the systems to integrate. The technologies listed (RPA, IPaaS, Kofax/Tungsten, Google, Mendix) are consistent with an integration/automation role. The profile assignment is straightforward based on the emphasis on integration over AI model development. A slightly lower score is given because the mention of 'AI/LLM' is brief and could imply a deeper involvement than just integration, but the overall context strongly suggests an integration focus."
