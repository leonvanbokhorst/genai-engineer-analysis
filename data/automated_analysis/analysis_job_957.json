        "rationale": "The job ad focuses exclusively on tasks related to training and evaluating generative AI models ('help train AI models', 'train AI large language models', 'Evaluating and ranking code generated by AI models'). While it mentions 'experienced software engineer', the core responsibilities described are centered on AI model development and data interaction for training purposes, rather than software integration or broader system building. There are no tasks related to Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering). Therefore, the role is best classified as a GenAI Specialist."
