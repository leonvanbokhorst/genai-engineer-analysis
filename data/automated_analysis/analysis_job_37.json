            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on software development using Go and leading technical roadmaps, with a secondary mention of AI-driven tools and a chatbot. However, it lacks the depth and specific responsibilities typically associated with an ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer, such as algorithm development, model training, fine-tuning, RAG systems, or deep involvement in generative model specifics. The primary focus is on building and scaling platform components and user-facing applications, with AI being a feature rather than the core technology being developed or specialized in. Therefore, it falls under the 'Ambiguous' category as it's primarily a software engineering leadership role with AI as a component, not a specialized AI role."
