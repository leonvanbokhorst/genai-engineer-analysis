            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on traditional software engineering (Go, platform development, community tools, user-facing applications) and mentions AI-driven tools and a chatbot as features of the platform. However, it lacks specific details about core AI/ML tasks like model development, fine-tuning, RAG implementation, or deep involvement with generative models beyond their integration into existing products. The emphasis is on leading code quality, technical roadmaps, and building scalable services, which aligns more with a senior software engineering role that *uses* AI components rather than one that *develops* them. The mention of 'generative AI tool that has already produced over 40+ million images' and 'AI-driven tools' suggests the *use* of AI rather than the *engineering* of AI models themselves. Therefore, it doesn't fit the core responsibilities of an ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer."
