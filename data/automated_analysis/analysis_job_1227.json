            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on data engineering tasks and the use of AI tools for customer care, including building chatbots and summarizing data. While it mentions 'generative AI models' and 'GenAI', it lacks depth in core generative AI engineering responsibilities such as fine-tuning LLMs, advanced prompt engineering, or building complex RAG systems. The primary emphasis is on data handling, infrastructure, and applying existing AI capabilities, rather than developing or deeply customizing generative AI models themselves. The role also mentions 'Data Scientists' and 'Cloud Specialists' as part of the team, suggesting a more specialized focus for this 'Data Engineer' role. The core responsibilities and technologies lean more towards data engineering and MLOps for AI applications rather than core GenAI development, making it ambiguous for a specialized GenAI Engineer profile."
