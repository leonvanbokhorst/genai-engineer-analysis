While 'LLM providers' are mentioned in the tech stack, there are no specific tasks described that involve working with or developing Generative AI models, prompt engineering, or RAG. The role is about building and scaling a platform, not about integrating or developing AI features. Therefore, it fits the 'Software Engineer' profile."

The mention of 'LLM providers' is in the context of a tech stack without associated tasks, making the classification straightforward."
