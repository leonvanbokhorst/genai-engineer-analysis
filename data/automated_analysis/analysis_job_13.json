            "rationale": "The job description emphasizes data science skills like exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and ML model training/testing. It mentions a range of AI technologies including computer vision, NLP, and LLMs, but the core focus appears to be on developing AI solutions and services for clients, with a strong component of MLOps for deployments. While LLMs are mentioned, the overall description leans more towards traditional ML engineering tasks and applying AI/ML to business outcomes, rather than the specialized focus on generative AI applications and advanced prompt engineering characteristic of a GenAI Engineer."
