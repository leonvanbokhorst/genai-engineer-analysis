            "rationale": "The job description emphasizes data science skills like exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and ML model training/testing. It mentions a range of AI technologies including computer vision, NLP, and LLMs, but the core focus appears to be on developing and deploying AI solutions that leverage these technologies for business outcomes, with a strong component of MLOps for deployment. While LLMs are mentioned, the emphasis on traditional ML model training and data science skills, along with the broader application of AI & Analytics for business outcomes, aligns more closely with the definition and evidence profile of an ML Engineer who productionizes models and works with data-driven algorithms."
