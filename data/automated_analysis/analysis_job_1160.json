        "rationale": "The job description heavily emphasizes traditional software engineering tasks such as developing back-end solutions, integrating features, building widgets, optimizing functionality, and conducting code reviews (Macro-Category A). While it mentions AI technologies like RAG, GPT-4, and generative AI, these are presented as components to be integrated into existing product lines rather than the primary focus of model development or deep AI research. The role aims to 'modernize our strategic product lines through AI-driven innovations' and 'integrate AI-driven solutions into our cloud services,' positioning the AI aspect as an augmentation to core software engineering. The tasks are predominantly focused on building and shipping software that *uses* AI, rather than specializing in the AI models themselves. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

        "score": 5,
        "reasoning": "The job advertisement is very clear about the nature of the role, explicitly detailing multiple product lines and the types of tasks involved. It uses specific AI terminology (RAG, GPT-4) within the context of software integration, and the overall emphasis is on building and modernizing software products with AI. The distinction between core software engineering and AI specialization is well-defined by the described responsibilities."
