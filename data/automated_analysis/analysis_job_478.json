While it mentions 'large language models', the core focus is on the performance engineering aspect of ML systems rather than the development or application of generative AI capabilities themselves. The tasks lean towards optimizing existing ML systems and their underlying infrastructure (1.A.1, 1.A.2, 1.B.1), rather than building GenAI-specific applications or models. Therefore, it aligns best with a 'Core ML Engineer' profile focused on performance."

It clearly distinguishes itself from a pure software engineering role or a generative AI specialist role. However, the mention of 'large language models' alongside traditional ML performance optimization could introduce a slight ambiguity, preventing a perfect score. The core focus remains on performance engineering of ML systems."
