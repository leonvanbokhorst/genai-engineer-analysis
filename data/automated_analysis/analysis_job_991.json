        "rationale": "The job ad explicitly seeks an 'experienced software engineer' whose 'coding expertise' will be used to 'train AI models'. While the task involves AI model training, the primary framing is that of a software engineer applying their skills to this domain. There is no mention of specific GenAI frameworks, LLM development, or advanced AI research tasks, nor traditional ML tasks. The focus is on using coding skills to support AI model improvement, aligning with the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "score": 3,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite brief and focuses heavily on the payment structure and contract details rather than the specific day-to-day tasks. While it mentions 'software engineer' and 'train AI models', it lacks detail on the specific AI technologies or the depth of AI involvement, making it difficult to definitively classify beyond the general 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile. The mention of 'generative AI models write better code' hints at GenAI, but it's not explicit enough to assign a 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile."
