            "rationale": "The job description focuses on providing human feedback to train AI models by crafting and evaluating questions and code. While it mentions 'generative AI models' and 'large language models', it does not involve the core responsibilities of developing, fine-tuning, or deploying these models. The role is primarily about human input for training, rather than engineering the AI systems themselves. This aligns with the definition of 'Ambiguous' as a role that primarily focuses on the USE of AI tools to enhance productivity or assist in AI development, rather than being a core AI engineering role."
