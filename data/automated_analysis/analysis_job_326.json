            "profile": "Ambiguous",
            "rationale": "The job description focuses on training AI models by providing human feedback, specifically crafting questions and evaluating code generated by AI. While it mentions 'generative AI models' and 'large language models', it does not involve the core responsibilities of developing, fine-tuning, or deploying these models. The role is primarily about human interaction and feedback on AI outputs, rather than the engineering or development of AI systems. The emphasis on 'coding expertise to train AI models' and 'talented coders to help train generative artificial intelligence models' suggests a role that uses coding skills for data annotation or evaluation, not for building AI systems. Therefore, it does not fit the profiles of ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer and is best classified as Ambiguous due to its focus on AI model training through human feedback rather than AI development."
