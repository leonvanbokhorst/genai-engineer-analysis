        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite specific about the tasks involved in training and evaluating AI models, which clearly points to a specialist role. However, it lacks detail on the specific AI models or technologies used, and it doesn't mention any core software engineering tasks. This makes the confidence high but not perfect."
