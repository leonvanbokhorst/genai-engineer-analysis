While it involves working with APIs, configurations, and Python scripts, the core responsibilities are centered around client interaction, problem-solving, and optimization of existing solutions, aligning more with a support or engineering role that utilizes AI tools rather than a core AI development role. There is no mention of core AI/ML tasks like model training, algorithm development, or generative model specifics."
