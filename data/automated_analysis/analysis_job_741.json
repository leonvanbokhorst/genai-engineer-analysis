            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on traditional full-stack development, including frontend (React) and backend (Python, FastAPI) services, API design, and database technologies. While it mentions 'LLM providers' and 'Cloud platforms and deployment tools', there is no specific mention of generative models, LLM frameworks, fine-tuning, RAG, or other core GenAI engineering tasks. The role appears to be a general software engineering position that might *integrate* with AI services rather than build or engineer AI models themselves. Therefore, it does not fit the 'ML Engineer' or 'GenAI Engineer' profiles and is classified as 'Ambiguous' due to its primary focus on traditional software development."
