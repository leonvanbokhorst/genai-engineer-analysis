This aligns directly with the core responsibilities of a GenAI Engineer, focusing on developing and fine-tuning generative models and integrating them into usable outputs. While there's an element of model training, the primary focus is on leveraging and controlling generative AI for visual outputs, rather than building predictive models from scratch, which would lean more towards an ML Engineer."
