    "profile": {
        "assigned_profile": "GenAI Specialist",
        "rationale": "The job ad focuses exclusively on tasks related to training and evaluating generative AI models, specifically in the context of code generation. While it mentions software engineering expertise as a desirable background, the core responsibilities (1.B.1: Model Development & Fine-Tuning) are centered around AI model interaction and improvement, with no mention of software integration (Macro-Category A) or traditional ML tasks. Therefore, 'GenAI Specialist' is the most fitting profile."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the tasks involved in training and evaluating AI models. However, it's a bit light on specific technologies or detailed software engineering aspects that would be expected in a more integrated role. The focus is clearly on the AI model training aspect, making the 'GenAI Specialist' profile a strong fit, but the lack of detail on the 'how' prevents a perfect score."
