            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on the use of AI as a tool to enhance existing software development processes and productivity, rather than on the core development, fine-tuning, or deployment of AI models themselves. Phrases like 'AI as their co-pilot', 'elevating your coding skills', 'crafting AI tools that clarify complex concepts', and 'AI as a booster, not a replacement' suggest a role that leverages AI for efficiency rather than building AI systems. There is a lack of specific technical details about model development, training, or deployment of generative models, which are characteristic of GenAI or ML Engineer roles. The emphasis is on 'software development' enhanced by AI, not on AI engineering itself."
