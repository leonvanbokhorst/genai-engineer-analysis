There is no mention of specific Generative AI tasks like prompt engineering, RAG, model fine-tuning, or specific GenAI models/frameworks. The role uses AI tools to improve coding efficiency but the core output is software development with AI integration, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering responsibilities and the integration of AI into those processes. However, it lacks specific details about the AI technologies or models used, making it slightly less definitive than a role that would detail specific GenAI tasks. The focus is clearly on software engineering augmented by AI."
