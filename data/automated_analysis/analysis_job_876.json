This aligns strongly with the core responsibilities of a GenAI Engineer, particularly in building and deploying applications on top of generative models and ensuring production-grade systems. While there's mention of AWS (Cloud Platforms), the primary focus is on generative AI tools and their integration into software solutions, rather than traditional ML model development or data engineering."
