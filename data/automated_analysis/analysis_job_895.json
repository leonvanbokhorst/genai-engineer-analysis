            "rationale": "The job description focuses on process automation using tools like UiPath and Node-RED, which are primarily for Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and workflow automation, rather than the core AI/ML model development, fine-tuning, or generative AI applications described in the ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer profiles. While it mentions 'emerging technologies' and 'innovative automation solutions', it lacks specific details about AI model building, data science, or advanced AI engineering tasks. The emphasis is on automating existing business processes, which aligns more with traditional automation engineering or RPA, and thus falls under the 'Ambiguous' category as it's not a core AI/ML role as defined in the Coding Book."
