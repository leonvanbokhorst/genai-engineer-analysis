            "rationale": "The job description heavily emphasizes profiling and analyzing AI workloads, specifically for distributed Deep Learning LLM training, focusing on performance bottlenecks and optimizations. While it mentions LLMs, the core tasks revolve around performance analysis, tool development for this purpose, and understanding system limitations, which aligns more closely with the 'ML Engineer' profile's focus on optimizing and productionizing models and systems, rather than building user-facing generative applications as the 'GenAI Engineer' profile does. The emphasis on 'performance analysis tools and methodologies' and 'benchmarking, profiling, and analyzing performance' points towards the core responsibilities of an ML Engineer in ensuring models and systems perform optimally."
