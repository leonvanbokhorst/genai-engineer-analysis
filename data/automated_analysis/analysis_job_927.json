            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on data engineering tasks such as designing, building, and optimizing data pipelines, data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation. While it mentions collaboration with data scientists and analysts for developing data models and pipelines for machine learning, it does not explicitly detail the development, fine-tuning, or deployment of generative AI models, prompt engineering, RAG systems, or complex agents, which are core to the GenAI Engineer profile. The role also lacks the emphasis on building user-facing applications that is characteristic of a GenAI Engineer. The primary focus remains on data infrastructure and processing, making it lean towards a traditional data engineering role rather than a specialized AI engineering role."
