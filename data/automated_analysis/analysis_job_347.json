We use the latest ML and AI techniques to deliver highly accurate models for supporting a variety of business applications and processes, including market demand, talent supply, career patterns, salaries and rates, and pricing.\n\n   The focus in this role will be working on our global taxonomy program, that is supporting our systems landscape worldwide. In this program we are creating and maintaining information on all kinds of vital elementary data concepts, such as jobs, occupations, skills, certificates, education and more. We are using the latest ML technology and LLMs to create our models, and present the results via ML pipelines with a balanced set of microservices.\n\n   You will be a part of an international and agile team of highly skilled specialists, including data scientists, ML engineers, data engineers, and data analysts. We have a major research background and are publishing some of our greatest work in academic papers.\n\n   You will work closely with other colleagues within the Randstad ecosystem, especially in the various global projects. The impact of your work depends not only on the quality of your products, but especially on your ability to communicate the value and proof of concept of your models and analyses.\n\n   what you will be doing\n\n   building Machine Learning (ML) models: preparing data from a wide variety of internal and external data sources; creating and evaluating ML models, primarily in the NLP domain, based a.o. on open source LLMs and GenAI;\n\n   * building ML pipelines that automate the training and deployment of models\n\n   * defining and appropriating work to the product backlog\n\n   * training and coaching junior team members\n\n   * collaborating within the data science community within the Randstad ecosystem, on sharing best practices, harmonizing ML models, and grow collective data science skills\n\n   who will you work with\n\n   Our global data science team helps our customers make better hiring decisions and helps talent advance in their career paths. We help people find work by creating new insights into the dynamics of the global labor market and integrate those insights into customer- and talent-focused data products. We build and deploy machine learning models and tell stories with those insights. As an example - we create clarity where there are gaps in diversity, what a talent's next job might be, how market conditions should influence a hiring strategy, where we predict demand will go, and much more.",
