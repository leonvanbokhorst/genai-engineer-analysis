The AI-related tasks, such as experimenting with machine learning models (including GPT) and utilizing customer documents, are presented as an 'opportunity' to expand AI knowledge and improve the product. This indicates that AI is an integrated component or an area for growth within a predominantly software engineering role, rather than the primary focus. Therefore, the profile of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer is the most fitting."

        "reasoning": "The core software engineering responsibilities are clearly defined. However, the AI-related tasks are described as an 'opportunity' for experimentation and learning, making their exact scope and weight in the role less definitive than in a role where AI is the primary focus. This leads to a high, but not perfect, confidence score."
