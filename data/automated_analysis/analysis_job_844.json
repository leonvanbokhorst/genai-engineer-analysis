While it mentions collaboration with LLM engineers and bringing prototypes to life, it lacks specific details about developing, fine-tuning, or deploying generative models themselves. The core responsibilities and technologies described align more with a traditional Data Engineer role supporting AI initiatives rather than a dedicated GenAI Engineer or ML Engineer role focused on model development and productionization."
