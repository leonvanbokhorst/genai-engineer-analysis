            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on Azure Systems Engineering, Infrastructure as Code, CI/CD pipelines, and scripting for system management. While it mentions an interest in exploring GenAI, LLMs, and Copilots, these are framed as areas for future exploration rather than core responsibilities. The primary duties align with traditional cloud infrastructure and DevOps roles, not with the development, fine-tuning, or deployment of generative AI models themselves. Therefore, it does not fit the 'ML Engineer' or 'GenAI Engineer' profiles and is classified as 'Ambiguous' as it's a technical role but not primarily focused on AI model development or application."
