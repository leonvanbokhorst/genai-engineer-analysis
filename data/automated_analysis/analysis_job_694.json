        "rationale": "The job description focuses exclusively on tasks related to maintaining and deploying existing Billing and Revenue Management (BRM) systems, such as diagnosing and resolving tickets, executing deployments, and conducting testing. These tasks fall under Macro-Category A: Core Software Engineering, specifically 1.A.1. Software Development & Integration. The advertisement explicitly states that the role does not involve new feature development, product innovation, strategic planning, or high-level architecture. While the ad mentions 'leveraging AI and automation' and an 'AI-first environment,' these are presented as tools to enhance the efficiency of the core software engineering tasks, not as the subject matter of the work itself. There are no tasks described that involve developing, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, RAG, or data engineering for AI/ML models, which would fall under Macro-Category B: GenAI Specialization. Therefore, the role is classified as Software Engineer because its tasks are exclusively within Macro-Category A, and it does not involve building or integrating AI models into the product, nor does it use AI-assisted tools for productivity in a way that defines the role's output as AI-powered."

This clarity allows for a confident classification."
