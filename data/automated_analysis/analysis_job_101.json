While it mentions catering to LLM applications and streaming APIs, it lacks specific details about generative AI model development, fine-tuning, RAG systems, or advanced prompt engineering, which are core to the GenAI Engineer profile. It also doesn't emphasize predictive modeling or MLOps for traditional ML models, ruling out the ML Engineer profile. The role appears to be more of a traditional backend/cloud engineer supporting AI applications rather than directly developing AI models or GenAI systems."
