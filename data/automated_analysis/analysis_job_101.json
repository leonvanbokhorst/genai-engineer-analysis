However, it lacks specific details about the core generative AI tasks such as fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or building RAG systems, which are central to the GenAI Engineer profile. While it mentions LLM applications, the emphasis is on the backend infrastructure and integration rather than the direct development or adaptation of generative models. The role appears to be more of a traditional backend/cloud engineer supporting LLM applications rather than a specialist in generative AI model development or application."
