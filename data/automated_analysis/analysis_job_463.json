            "rationale": "The job description focuses on IT Security Engineering, which involves securing applications, systems, and infrastructure. While it mentions automation within the development lifecycle and improving security of infrastructure, network, and services, it does not align with the core responsibilities or typical projects of an ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer as defined in the Coding Book. The role is primarily focused on security operations and engineering rather than AI model development or deployment. Therefore, it falls under the 'Ambiguous' category as it is not a technical AI role as defined."
