        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on tasks related to training and evaluating generative AI models, such as creating questions for training and evaluating AI-generated code. While it mentions software engineering expertise, the core responsibilities are centered around the AI model's learning process rather than integrating AI into a larger software product. There are no explicit software development or MLOps tasks mentioned. Therefore, the 'GenAI Specialist' profile is the most appropriate fit."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines tasks related to training and evaluating generative AI models. However, it is relatively brief and lacks specific details about the technologies or the broader software engineering context. The absence of explicit software development tasks (Macro-Category A) makes the 'GenAI Specialist' profile a strong candidate, but a lack of detail prevents a perfect score."
