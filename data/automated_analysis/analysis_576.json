While LLMs are mentioned as the target application, the core responsibilities and required skills do not align with the specialized tasks of a GenAI Engineer, such as prompt engineering or fine-tuning models. The role appears to be more about building infrastructure and backend systems for LLM applications rather than developing the AI models themselves."
