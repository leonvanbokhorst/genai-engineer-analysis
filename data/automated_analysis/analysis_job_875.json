While AI/GenAI tools are mentioned, they are used as tools within the context of quality assurance and software testing, not for core AI model development or GenAI application building. The tasks fall under Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering), specifically within software development and integration (1.A.1), with no tasks from Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization). Therefore, the role is classified as a Software Engineer."
