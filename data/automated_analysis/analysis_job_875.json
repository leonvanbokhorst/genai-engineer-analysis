However, it lacks specific details about generative AI models, LLM frameworks, or core AI/ML modeling tasks. The primary focus remains on Salesforce platform customization and CI/CD, which does not align with the core responsibilities of an ML Engineer or a GenAI Engineer as defined in the coding book. Therefore, it falls under the 'Ambiguous' category as it's primarily a business-focused technical role not directly centered on AI/ML development."
