        "assigned_profile": "ML Specialist (Data Scientist)",
        "rationale": "The job advertisement explicitly mentions the task of 'build a state-of-the-art recommender system', which falls under 1.B.1. Model Development & Fine-Tuning (Macro-Category B) and pertains to traditional ML. No tasks from Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration, Operations & MLOps) are mentioned. Therefore, the role is predominantly focused on ML specialization."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 2,
        "reasoning": "The job advertisement is extremely brief and lacks specific details about the actual responsibilities, technologies, or required skills beyond the general area of building recommender systems. The majority of the text pertains to benefits, diversity, and legal information, providing very little substance for a comprehensive analysis. This makes it difficult to confidently assign a profile beyond the most basic interpretation of the title and the single task mentioned."
