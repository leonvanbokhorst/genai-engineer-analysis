            "rationale": "The job description focuses on data engineering and analytics tasks, specifically mentioning DBT, BigQuery, and Looker for data modeling and dataset creation. While it mentions 'Generative AI' in the context of empowering business users with a personalized data analyst, it does not describe core responsibilities or projects related to developing, fine-tuning, or deploying generative models themselves. The primary focus remains on data infrastructure, data modeling, and enabling data-driven approaches, rather than building AI systems. Therefore, it does not fit the criteria for ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer and is best classified as Ambiguous."
