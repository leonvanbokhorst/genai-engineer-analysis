        "rationale": "The job description focuses on integrating AI capabilities into customer resolutions and improving AI systems through feedback and fine-tuning. While there's an element of AI specialization (improving AI systems, fine-tuning), the primary context is applying these improvements to customer support resolutions and prototyping new AI tools within that framework. The role is not about building core AI models from scratch or deep research, but rather about leveraging and enhancing existing AI to improve a software-driven support function. The tasks lean more towards the application and integration of AI within a broader system rather than deep AI model development or specialized GenAI tasks. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to AI integration and improvement within a customer support context. While it doesn't explicitly mention specific GenAI technologies like LLMs or RAG, the tasks of improving AI systems and fine-tuning are indicative of AI work. The soft skills are also clearly articulated. The confidence is high, but not perfect, as the ad could be more specific about the *type* of AI being used."
