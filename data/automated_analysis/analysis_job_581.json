This aligns directly with the definition and core responsibilities of a GenAI Engineer, particularly in areas like advanced prompt engineering, fine-tuning LLMs, and developing user-facing systems. While there's a mention of 'modelling', the context is specifically generative models and LLMs, not traditional predictive modeling."
