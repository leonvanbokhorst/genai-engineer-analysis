This aligns strongly with the core responsibilities of a GenAI Engineer, particularly in areas like fine-tuning LLMs and building agentic systems, as well as the need for software development to integrate these capabilities into user-facing systems. While ML modeling is mentioned, the focus on LLMs and agentic flows points more towards GenAI than traditional ML Engineering."
