Do you want to rise above yourself, in your profession, and as a person? Do you want to be challenged every day? At the TU/e, scientists and students continuously create the unthinkable. These creative minds expect you to offer them a solution for tomorrow that doesn't exist today.\n\n   You will closely work with researchers, students of all departments, and TU/e institutes as well as with industry partners. You have AI and HPC infrastructure engineering know-how, but your main focus and interest are on the application and workflow side. You will work in a team of highly motivated experts and can help us shape the future of our university, scientists, and students.\n\n   The job entails:\n     * Assisting researchers and students to efficiently deploy scientific workloads on the various AI/HPC platforms, such as batch computing clusters (local clusters, SURF CPU/GPU clusters) and cloud infrastructure (like Azure and Rescale).\n     * Working with researchers to understand and optimize their application (benchmarking, code optimization).\n     * Optimizing application workflow (pre-processing, simulation, post-processing, data storage, etc.) to make the best use of a given platform.\n     * Benchmarking and administration/accounting of workloads.\n     * Training and communication for end-users.",
