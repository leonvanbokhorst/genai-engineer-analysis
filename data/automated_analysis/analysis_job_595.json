While it mentions 'intelligent processes' and 'data-driven steering', it does not involve the development, fine-tuning, or deployment of generative AI models, nor does it focus on predictive modeling in the way an ML Engineer would. The role is primarily about data integration, analysis, and governance for business and compliance needs, making it a traditional data engineering role rather than a specialized AI/ML role."
