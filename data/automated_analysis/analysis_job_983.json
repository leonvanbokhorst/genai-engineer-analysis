    "profile": {

        "rationale": "The job ad focuses exclusively on tasks related to training and evaluating AI models, specifically generative AI models. Phrases like 'help train AI models', 'train generative artificial intelligence models', 'Crafting and answering questions... to help train AI models', and 'Evaluating and ranking code generated by AI models' all fall under Macro-Category B: GenAI Specialization, specifically 1.B.1 Model Development & Fine-Tuning. There are no tasks mentioned that fall under Macro-Category A: Core Software Engineering. Therefore, the role is predominantly focused on AI specialization, leading to the 'ML Specialist (Data Scientist)' profile, with the understanding that the specialization is in Generative AI."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the core tasks related to AI model training and evaluation. However, it is light on specific technologies and the 'soft skills' section is inferred rather than explicitly stated. The profile assignment is strong based on the task descriptions, but the lack of detail on other aspects prevents a perfect score."
