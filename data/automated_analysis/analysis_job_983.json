            "rationale": "The job description focuses on providing human feedback to train AI models and mentions 'lending coding expertise to train AI models' and 'helping cutting-edge generative AI models write better code'. However, it lacks specific details about core AI engineering tasks such as algorithm development, model training, fine-tuning, or deployment. The primary focus appears to be on the human-in-the-loop aspect of AI training rather than the direct engineering of AI systems. The role is described as a 'Back End Developer - AI Trainer' and emphasizes 'coding experts' but doesn't detail the engineering responsibilities typically associated with ML or GenAI Engineer profiles. The description is also very brief and lacks the depth required to confidently classify it under ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer."
