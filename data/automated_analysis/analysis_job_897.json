While it mentions 'emerging technologies' and 'optimizing operations', it lacks specific details about AI model training, fine-tuning, RAG, or LLMs, which are central to the GenAI Engineer and ML Engineer profiles. The emphasis is on automating existing business processes rather than building AI-driven products or predictive systems."
