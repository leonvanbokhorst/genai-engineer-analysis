            "profile": "GenAI Engineer",
            "rationale": "The job description emphasizes building software applications, enabling ML decisioning for personalized recommendations, and specifically mentions a key role in a new GenAI project ('The Trip Planner'). It also highlights responsibilities like monitoring application health, evaluating architecture solutions, and identifying improvements, which align with the development and deployment aspects of a GenAI Engineer. The mention of 'GenAI project' strongly points towards this profile over an ML Engineer, which focuses more on predictive modeling and less on building user-facing applications with generative technologies."
