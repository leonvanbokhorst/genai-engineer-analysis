While it involves AI use cases, there's no explicit mention of core GenAI tasks like prompt engineering, RAG, or fine-tuning LLMs, nor is there a strong emphasis on building production-grade GenAI applications. The primary focus seems to be on infrastructure and support for traditional data science workflows."
