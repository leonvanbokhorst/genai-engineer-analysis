While it mentions 'Document Translation service', there is no indication of involvement with AI/ML models, generative AI, prompt engineering, or related specialized tasks. The technologies mentioned (C#, backend services) are also standard software engineering tools. Therefore, the role is classified as a Software Engineer."
