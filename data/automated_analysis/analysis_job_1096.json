These are predominantly software development and integration tasks (Macro-Category A). While specific AI technologies like LLMs and GPT-4 Vision are mentioned, the core responsibility is integrating and maintaining these within software systems, rather than deep model development or specialized GenAI research. The role supports internal teams and end-users, indicating an integration focus. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering responsibilities related to AI integration. The mention of specific AI technologies is present but the emphasis remains on building, maintaining, and integrating these into platforms. The profile assignment is relatively straightforward based on this emphasis. A score of 4 reflects high confidence, with a slight deduction because the term 'AI Software Engineer' in the title could be interpreted broadly, but the detailed tasks clarify the 'adjacent' nature."
