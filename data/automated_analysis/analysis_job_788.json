During the terms of internship, you will be working on developing few innovative ideas and performing some project work. Pont Renewables has recently been awarded with MIT feasibility study grant by province of South Holland, which will be the basis if the study of this internship in the field of application of Artificial Intelligence in Renewable Energy projects.\n\n   Your work will be in relation about some of the largest utility scale solar projects internationally, with the focus on the Netherlands, and Northwest Europe. Pont Renewables has been working on renewable projects across Europe and the range of service offerings differ from feasibility studies to applications of different software solutions for project development of renewable assets.\n   Tasks/assignment\n\n   At Pont, we see digital technology and digitalization as key enablers of the transition to a low-carbon energy system. Our vision is clear: agile, smaller-scale entities are crucial in shaping a sustainable energy future, realizaztion of climate action goals, and making significant meaningful progress in domains often less traverses by larger organisations.\n\n   We have been developing data driven digital tools to have a role in this rapidly changing energy landscape. These tools help us to contribute to acceleration of energy transition, save additional costs on the operation of solar plants and help our customers to prolong the lifetime of their assets, which directly results in lower Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE). With the recent developments in the field of generative AI, we see a great potential to be tapped to further facilitate and accelerate renewable project developments.\n\n   What we're offering\n\n   · A challenging opportunity with international exposure\n\n   · Getting familiar with the international best industry practices in the field of renewable energy, applying advanced AI technologies.\n\n   · A potential chance to learn consultancy skills in practice through renewable energy projects involving several types of stakeholders.",
