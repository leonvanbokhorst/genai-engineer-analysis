            "profile": "Ambiguous",
            "rationale": "The job description focuses on leveraging AI advancements for portfolio management and analytics within real estate investment. While it mentions LLMs and an analytics platform, it does not detail the development, fine-tuning, or deployment of these models. The core responsibilities revolve around using existing AI tools for research, analytics, and investment recommendations, rather than building or engineering AI systems from scratch. The role emphasizes quantitative analysis, data interpretation, and business application of AI, aligning more with a user or analyst role of AI tools rather than a GenAI Engineer or ML Engineer who builds and maintains AI models and systems. Therefore, it falls under the 'Ambiguous' category as it primarily focuses on the use of AI tools to enhance productivity and decision-making in a business context, rather than core AI development."
