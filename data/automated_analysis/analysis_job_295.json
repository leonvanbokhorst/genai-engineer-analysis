Phrases like 'help train AI models', 'train AI large language models', 'Crafting and answering questions related to computer science in order to help train AI models', and 'Evaluating and ranking code generated by AI models' all fall under 'Model Development & Fine-Tuning' (1.B.1). There are no tasks related to software development and integration (Macro-Category A) or core software engineering operations. While it mentions 'experienced software engineer', the core responsibilities are centered on the AI model's learning process rather than building software around it. Therefore, the role is best classified as a specialist focused on the AI model itself, specifically in the domain of generative AI, making 'ML Specialist (Data Scientist)' the most fitting profile, with the understanding that the 'ML' here broadly covers AI model training and evaluation, and the 'Specialist' aspect is due to the lack of software engineering tasks."
    },
    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the core tasks related to AI model training and evaluation. However, it lacks specific details about the technologies used or the depth of involvement in model architecture or fine-tuning beyond data creation and evaluation. The mention of 'experienced software engineer' could be interpreted in different ways, but the tasks themselves lean heavily towards model specialization. The confidence is high because the core function is clear, but not perfect due to the lack of technical specifics and potential ambiguity in the 'software engineer' descriptor."
