It does not involve building, training, fine-tuning, or deploying AI models from a technical engineering perspective, nor does it involve core software development tasks for AI applications. The role is primarily about providing human input for AI training, which aligns with the definition of 'Ambiguous' as a role that primarily focuses on the use of AI tools to enhance productivity or assist in AI development rather than being a core AI engineering role."
