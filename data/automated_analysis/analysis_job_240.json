            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on pre-sales technical support, customer engagement, and sales enablement rather than the core development, implementation, or deployment of AI models or systems. While it mentions technical aspects and IT environments, it lacks specific details on AI/ML tasks, technologies, or methodologies that would align it with ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer profiles. The emphasis on 'SaaS packages and functionality', 'technical advisor', 'sales strategies', and 'RFPs' points towards a sales-oriented technical role, not a development or engineering role."
