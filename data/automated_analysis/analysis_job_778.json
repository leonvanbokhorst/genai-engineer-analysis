While GenAI is mentioned, the core tasks are related to software development, integration, and operations (DevOps/MLOps). There is no mention of model training, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or specific GenAI model development. This indicates the role is about integrating and operationalizing GenAI within software systems, rather than specializing in the AI models themselves, fitting the AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

The confidence is high, but not perfect (5) because 'embedding GenAI' could have a slightly broader interpretation, though the DevOps context strongly anchors it to integration and operations."
