        "rationale": "The job ad describes a blend of core software engineering tasks (data pipelines, Linux server management) and specific Generative AI tasks (GenAI Suite, Klus Coach). While Dataiku is mentioned for data science support, the emphasis on generative AI projects and the integration of these into client-facing tools, alongside data engineering responsibilities, points towards a balanced role focused on GenAI. The presence of both 'Data Engineer' and 'AI Engineer' in the title, with specific generative AI projects listed, solidifies this classification."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to both data engineering and generative AI. The mention of specific GenAI projects like 'GenAI Suite' and 'Klus Coach' provides good evidence for the AI specialization. The tasks are well-defined, leading to a confident classification. A slightly lower score is given because 'GenAI Suite' and 'Klus Coach' are project names and not explicit technologies, and the exact nature of the 'Generative AI' tasks (e.g., prompt engineering vs. model fine-tuning) isn't detailed, but the overall context strongly suggests a GenAI focus."
