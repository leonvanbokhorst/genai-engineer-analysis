While it mentions 'LLM providers' and 'REST APIs', it lacks specific details about developing, fine-tuning, or deploying generative AI models, which are core to the GenAI Engineer profile. The primary responsibilities and technologies listed align more with a general backend or DevOps role, rather than a specialized AI engineering position. The mention of LLM providers appears to be in the context of integration or utilization rather than core development of AI models."
