While there's an element of AI improvement (1.B.1), the core responsibility is the integration and application of AI within a broader support function, aligning with Macro-Category A tasks. The role is about using and enhancing AI within a software context rather than developing AI models from scratch or specializing deeply in GenAI techniques. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines tasks related to AI integration and improvement within a customer support context. The distinction between core AI development and applying AI in a support role is evident. However, the ad is relatively brief and doesn't go into deep technical detail about the specific AI models or methodologies, which prevents a perfect score."
