It does not involve the core responsibilities or technologies associated with ML Engineering or GenAI Engineering, such as developing predictive models, fine-tuning LLMs, or building RAG systems. The role's focus on security improvements, threat recognition, vulnerability triage, and automating security processes falls outside the scope of the defined AI/ML engineering profiles. Therefore, it is classified as 'Ambiguous' as it is not a technical AI/ML role."
