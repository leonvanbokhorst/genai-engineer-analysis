It does not involve building, training, fine-tuning, or deploying AI models from a technical engineering perspective, nor does it involve core software development tasks related to AI applications. The role is primarily about providing human input to train existing AI models, which aligns with the definition of 'Ambiguous' as a role that primarily focuses on the use of AI tools to enhance productivity or assist in tasks, rather than the development or engineering of AI systems themselves."
