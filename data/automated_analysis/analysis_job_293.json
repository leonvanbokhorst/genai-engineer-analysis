It lacks the core responsibilities and evidence profiles of an ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer, such as algorithm development, model training, MLOps, or building generative AI applications. The role is primarily about interacting with and providing feedback on AI outputs, which aligns with the definition of the 'Ambiguous' profile."
