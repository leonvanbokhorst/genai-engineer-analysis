            "profile": "Ambiguous",
            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on traditional backend development tasks such as API integration, microservices, CI/CD, automated testing, and code quality. While it mentions 'AI messaging systems' and 'AI industry', it lacks specific details about developing, fine-tuning, or deploying generative models, RAG systems, or advanced prompt engineering, which are core to a GenAI Engineer role. It also doesn't emphasize predictive modeling or MLOps in the context of ML models, ruling out an ML Engineer profile. The role appears to be primarily about building and maintaining the backend infrastructure that might support AI features, rather than being an AI development role itself, thus fitting the 'Ambiguous' profile."
