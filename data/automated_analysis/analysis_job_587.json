While it mentions ML/GenAI in the context of evolving threats, the core responsibilities and required skills are centered around software development, integration, and security posture enhancement, without any specific tasks related to building, fine-tuning, or implementing ML/GenAI models themselves. Therefore, the role is classified as a 'Software Engineer'."
