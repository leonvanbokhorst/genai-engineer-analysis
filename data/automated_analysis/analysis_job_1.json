In practice, that means helping ambitious leaders and organisations build the teams, products, processes and even operational structures they need to close the digital skills gap within their organisation today, so that they thrive tomorrow.\n\n   Clients rely on our experience, agility and craft skills across tech and business strategy, software development and product management to address some of the toughest challenges facing their businesses.\n\n   We bring aboard thinkers, tinkerers, passionate software craftspeople and inspiring technologists to help us solve these challenges. Together, we're united by a sense of pragmatism, purpose and a deeply-held belief that digital products and technology alone won't transform a business or save the world: it's the people that count.\n\n   About You\n\n   As an AI/ML Full Stack Engineer, at AND Digital you'll act as a hands on, Engineer working across a Club's portfolio of clients, onsite and in multi-skilled agile delivery teams. As a result, you will need to be able to:\n     * Work with junior developers in the field of AI and ML engineering on your team through technical issues.\n     * Guide and support the improvement of data skills for the junior developers in your team.\n     * Work closely with clients to help implement, review or remediate their machine learning strategies.\n\n   To do that, it's essential you bring the following:\n     *\n          + Proficiency in writing and testing production-ready Python\n          + Proficiency in Python and Javascript\n          + Proficiency in researching, training, building, evaluating, scaling and improving Machine Learning models.\n          + Experience working in Azure\n          + Solid understanding of vector databases (Azure Cognitive Search, FAISS, Pinecone, etc..)\n          + Experience working with GenAI tools (ChatGPT, OpenAI APIs, Long Chain, etc...)\n          + Experience with AI/ML toolkits and libraries.

Not 'resources' or 'staff'. That means happiness and wellbeing really do matter to us, and we hate unnecessary hierarchy and bureaucracy.\n     * There's no well-trodden path ahead: AND is growing fast and forging a new trail. That's exciting, and gives us all the autonomy and opportunity we love - but bear in mind it also demands focus, patience and resilience.\n     * Diversity is a priority. After all, to build great products that a wide variety of different people love to use, we need a wide variety of people to help us build them. So diversity is more than a policy or a word: it's business critical for us.\n\n   Still sound good? Great!
