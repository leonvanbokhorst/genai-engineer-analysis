While it mentions 'AI (LLM)' and 'Azure Cloud Stack', these appear to be technologies to work with rather than the core focus of developing or specializing in AI/ML models themselves. The role is about building software that might *integrate* or *utilize* AI, but the primary responsibilities and skills listed are firmly in the realm of software engineering. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

The mention of AI is present but not dominant, and the role's description aligns well with integrating AI into a software product rather than specializing in AI model development. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the depth of AI integration is not fully detailed."
