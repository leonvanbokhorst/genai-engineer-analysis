            "rationale": "The job description emphasizes building and deploying AI solutions, integrating models with applications via APIs, and experimenting with new technologies. While it mentions 'model based solutions' and 'AI components', the focus on 'scalable AI solutions in a cloud environment', 'integrating the final model with other aspects of the application', and 'design and control how they communicate with one another (REST APIs, database queries, etc..)' strongly aligns with the responsibilities of a GenAI Engineer who builds user-facing systems. The mention of 'data platform' and 'Apache spark' suggests data engineering aspects, but the core is application development around AI. The 'ML Engineer' profile is less fitting as the emphasis is not solely on predictive modeling algorithms but on the integration and deployment of AI solutions into applications."
