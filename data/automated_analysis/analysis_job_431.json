While it mentions 'generative AI journey' and 'AI-driven innovations', it lacks specific details on building or adapting LLMs, RAG systems, or PEFT, which are hallmarks of a GenAI Engineer. The core responsibilities lean towards leveraging AI tools for software engineering tasks and modernizing products, aligning more with the 'use of AI tools to enhance productivity' aspect of the Ambiguous profile."
