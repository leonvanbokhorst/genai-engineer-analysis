            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on customer success, product enablement, and consultative support for a data analytics platform (Dataiku). While it mentions AI/ML and Gen AI in the context of customer use cases, the core responsibilities are centered around increasing adoption, user engagement, and providing hands-on support for the platform itself, rather than developing, building, or deploying AI models. The role is technical and consultative but does not involve core AI engineering tasks like algorithm development, model training, or MLOps. It leans more towards a customer-facing technical support and enablement role, which aligns with the 'Ambiguous' profile as it's not a core AI engineering role."
