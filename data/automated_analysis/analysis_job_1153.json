        "rationale": "The job description heavily emphasizes traditional software engineering tasks such as designing, building, integrating, architecting, and deploying robust and scalable solutions ('AI automations', 'AI systems'). While it mentions experimenting with specific AI tools like GPT-4 Vision and optimizing AI solutions on AWS, the core focus remains on the engineering and integration of these AI components into broader systems, rather than deep model development or specialization in generative AI techniques themselves. The role appears to be about building software that leverages AI, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities that blend software engineering with AI integration. The tasks are specific enough to categorize, and the technologies mentioned are identifiable. The profile assignment is straightforward based on the balance of tasks. A score of 4 reflects high confidence, with a slight deduction because the ad doesn't delve into the depth of AI model specifics or complex MLOps practices, leaving a small room for interpretation on the exact technical focus within AI."
