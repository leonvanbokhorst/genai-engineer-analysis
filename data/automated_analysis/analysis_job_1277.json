The core responsibilities fall under Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration). While GenAI is mentioned as the technology focus, the tasks described are primarily about leading the software development lifecycle and integration, rather than deep model development, fine-tuning, or prompt engineering. The role requires understanding GenAI technologies to enhance services but doesn't mandate hands-on model building or specialized GenAI tasks as the primary focus. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly positions the role as a 'Lead Software Engineer' with a focus on delivery and integration. The responsibilities are predominantly aligned with software engineering tasks (Macro-Category A). While GenAI is mentioned, the depth of GenAI-specific tasks (Macro-Category B) is not detailed, making it lean towards an adjacent role rather than a core GenAI role. The confidence is high due to the clear emphasis on software engineering leadership and delivery, but not a perfect 5 because the specific nature of the 'GenAI components' integration could imply more specialized work than explicitly stated."
