While there is mention of collaboration with AI/ML teams and using AI tools in DevSecOps tasks, the core focus is on the engineering and operational aspects of software delivery and security, not on the development or fine-tuning of generative models themselves. Therefore, it does not fit the profile of a GenAI Engineer."
