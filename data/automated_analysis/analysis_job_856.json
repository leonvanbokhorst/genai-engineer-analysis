            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on general software engineering principles, multidisciplinary teamwork, and soft skills development. While it mentions 'generative AI' as a training area, it does not specify any core responsibilities or required technologies related to building, fine-tuning, or deploying generative AI models. The emphasis is on general software craftsmanship and impact, rather than specialized AI engineering tasks. Therefore, it falls under the 'Ambiguous' category as it's not a dedicated AI role."
