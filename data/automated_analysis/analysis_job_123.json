        "rationale": "The job ad focuses on developing online creations, banner creation, social media ads, online videos, and creative concepts/tools. It mentions Generative AI as an example of an innovative solution to build upon, but the core tasks described are traditional software development and creative asset creation. There are no specific tasks related to AI/ML model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or MLOps. The role is primarily about building and integrating digital assets and tools, fitting the 'Software Engineer' profile."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is clear about the nature of the work being creative development and online asset creation. While it mentions Generative AI as a potential area, the core responsibilities are firmly rooted in traditional software development and design. The confidence is high because the primary tasks are well-defined, but not a perfect 5 as the mention of Generative AI could imply a slight overlap, though not detailed enough to shift the profile."
