        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on the application of Artificial Intelligence and generative AI within the renewable energy sector, mentioning 'data driven digital tools' and the potential of 'generative AI'. While it mentions 'applying advanced AI technologies', it lacks specific details on software development, integration, or MLOps. The tasks lean towards understanding and applying AI/GenAI concepts to business problems rather than building production-ready software systems. Therefore, it aligns best with an 'ML Specialist (Data Scientist)' profile, with a leaning towards GenAI due to the explicit mention of generative AI."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 3,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is somewhat vague about the specific technical tasks involved. While it mentions AI and generative AI, it doesn't detail the development, integration, or operational aspects that would clearly define a Core GenAI Engineer or AI-Adjacent Software Engineer. The focus is more on the application and potential of AI in the renewable energy field, making it lean towards a specialist role but without enough detail to be highly confident. The mention of 'electrical engineer' in the title also adds a layer of ambiguity regarding the primary focus."
