            "rationale": "The job description is for a 'Full Stack Developer' and focuses on building user-facing applications and backend services. While it mentions integrating AI models and working with AI/NLP technologies, the core responsibilities and required skills are centered around traditional full-stack development (frontend, backend, databases, APIs) rather than the specialized tasks of an ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer, such as model development, fine-tuning, or advanced prompt engineering. The role is more about consuming AI capabilities within an application rather than developing or deeply specializing in AI models themselves. Therefore, it falls under the 'Ambiguous' category as it's not a primary AI development role."
