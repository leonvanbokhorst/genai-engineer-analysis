Jigsaw is revolutionizing consulting by harnessing the power of AI to cut through the noise and let you focus on what truly matters: delivering high-impact results for clients. If you're driven by innovation and want to be at the forefront of AI-enhanced project delivery, this role is tailor-made for you.\n\n   Jigsaw is fundamentally rethinking how projects are delivered, using generative AI to automate the mundane and elevate the strategic. Say goodbye to the grind of manual configuration, which you are overqualified to do anyway, and hello to a world where AI does the heavy lifting, freeing you to focus on building systems and delivering unparalleled client service.\n\n   This isn't your average consulting gig.

            "profile": "Ambiguous",
            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on the application and utilization of generative AI tools to enhance existing consulting workflows and client service delivery. It explicitly states 'Coding or programming' is NOT a requirement and emphasizes using AI to 'automate the mundane' and 'freeing you to focus on building systems and delivering unparalleled client service.' While generative AI is mentioned, the role does not involve developing, fine-tuning, or deploying AI models themselves, nor does it require deep technical expertise in ML/GenAI engineering tasks like algorithm development, data engineering for model training, or MLOps. The core function appears to be leveraging AI as a tool within a consulting framework, aligning with the definition of the 'Ambiguous' profile for roles primarily focused on the use of AI tools to enhance productivity rather than AI development."
