Jigsaw is revolutionizing consulting by harnessing the power of AI to cut through the noise and let you focus on what truly matters: delivering high-impact results for clients. If you're driven by innovation and want to be at the forefront of AI-enhanced project delivery, this role is tailor-made for you.\n\n   Jigsaw is fundamentally rethinking how projects are delivered, using generative AI to automate the mundane and elevate the strategic. Say goodbye to the grind of manual configuration, which you are overqualified to do anyway, and hello to a world where AI does the heavy lifting, freeing you to focus on building systems and delivering unparalleled client service.\n\n   This isn't your average consulting gig. If you're looking to spend your days entrenched in manual tasks, this isn't the job for you. Instead, we need someone who thrives on using AI to push boundaries, someone who relishes the challenge of aligning technology with client business goals. You'll be advising on everything from survey design to panel creation, all while ensuring that the solutions you deliver are flawlessly aligned with client expectations.\n\n   Join us if you're excited by the idea of transforming the consulting landscape, if you want to leave behind the old ways and embrace a role where your strategic input has real, measurable impact. This is your chance to be part of a team that's not just keeping up with the future of consulting but defining it. If that sounds like you, we want to hear from you.\n\n   What you will be doing\n\n     * AI-Enhanced Project Delivery: Using generative AI to improve project delivery, customer communications, and validation of project deliverables.\n     * Consulting Services: Gathering and analyzing customer business requirements, advising on survey structure, best practices for panel creation, and training clients on the software platform.\n     * Configuration Services: Configuring surveys, panels, and data gathering processes within the software platform.\n\n   What you will NOT be doing\n\n     * Manually reviewing every knowledge base article and Excel trackers\n     * Creating slide decks\n     * Traveling to client sites\n     * Coding or programming, * Ensure 100% of clients achieve 100% of their business goals through AI-driven professional services engagements",
