The core responsibilities involve building a 'conversational engine' with a Python backend, a React/Redux front-end UI, and a FastAPI-based BFF for enriching conversations. This aligns with the GenAI Engineer profile's focus on developing and deploying applications built on generative models, including building user-facing software systems and integrating AI capabilities. While there's software development, the primary focus is on AI-driven conversational applications rather than general predictive modeling."
