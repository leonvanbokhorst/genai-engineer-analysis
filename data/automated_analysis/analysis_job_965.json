        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on tasks related to training and evaluating generative AI models, specifically in the context of code generation. While it mentions software engineering expertise is beneficial, the core responsibilities (1.B.1: Model Development & Fine-Tuning) are centered around AI model interaction and improvement, with no mention of software integration (1.A.1) or MLOps (1.A.2). The role is about directly contributing to the AI model's learning process rather than building software around it."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the core tasks related to AI model training and evaluation. However, it is light on specific technologies and the 'software engineer' aspect is more about leveraging existing coding skills than building software systems. The profile assignment is clear based on the task focus, but the lack of technical specifics prevents a perfect score."
