            "profile": "Ambiguous",
            "rationale": "The job description focuses on designing and refining AI tools to enhance customer service, including predicting client needs and automating responses. However, it lacks specific technical details about model development, deep learning frameworks, or advanced AI engineering tasks. The emphasis is on the application and integration of AI for customer support, rather than the core development or deep technical expertise typically associated with ML or GenAI Engineering roles. The responsibilities lean towards using AI to improve existing processes and educating teams, which aligns more with a business-focused or application-oriented role rather than a specialized AI engineering position. Therefore, 'Ambiguous' is the most appropriate classification as it does not fit the core definitions of ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer."
