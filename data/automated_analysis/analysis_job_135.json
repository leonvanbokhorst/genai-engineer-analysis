While it mentions 'generative AI' as a technology to innovate support processes, it lacks the specific tasks and technologies associated with ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer roles, such as algorithm development, model training, fine-tuning, or building RAG systems. The emphasis is on advising customers and improving service practices, aligning more with a customer-facing or business-oriented role."
