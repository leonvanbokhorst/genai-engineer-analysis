            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on customer success, support, and operational improvements within a company's service offerings. While it mentions 'generative AI' as a potential technology to innovate support processes, it does not indicate that the role involves direct development, fine-tuning, or deployment of AI models. The core responsibilities are centered around customer advisory, solution deployment, and improving service practices, which aligns more with a customer-facing or operations role rather than a specialized AI engineering role. The mention of 'state-of-the-art technologies' and 'latest tools and developments in customer success' is too general to classify it as an ML or GenAI Engineer role without more specific technical duties related to AI model building or MLOps."
