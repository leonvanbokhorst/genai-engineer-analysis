Additionally, you review the quality of the exams through item and test analysis. You work on all exams that form part of EXIN's certification portfolio.\n\n   Importantly, you will collaborate closely with the Exam Developers to integrate generative AI solutions into our processes. You can translate internal guidelines into machine learning algorithms while maintaining legal, qualitative, and ethical compliance in the outcomes. You stay up to date with the latest research and developments in the field of AI and machine learning.\n\nWhere you come in\n\n   You are part of a committed team of Exam Developers, working closely with the Product Owner to ensure that the products in EXIN's certification portfolio are aligned with the needs of the market. You coordinate work with the Exam Developers and with small groups of international subject matter experts or third parties., * Coordinating work with subject matter experts and cooperating with third parties in creating, localizing, implementing, and maintaining exam products\n     * Ensuring deliverables are in line with high-quality standards, within budget, and delivered on time\n     * (Co)developing and improving exam products in line with guidelines for educational measurement\n     * Testing exam products (exams and corresponding materials) for the other team members\n     * Independently writing and maintaining machine learning algorithms complying with standards, best practices, and company policies\n     * Supporting our Customer Success Center by preparing responses to customer questions on the content of the exams\n     * Detecting (using test analysis) and resolving issues related to the exam products, and performing root cause analyses to take corrective actions\n     * Keeping your knowledge in the domain up-to-date\n     * Representing EXIN through attending (online) events\n\n   What's in it for you?\n\n   You get the opportunity to further develop your exam-related skills and experience in generative AI, your language skills, and your project management skills.
