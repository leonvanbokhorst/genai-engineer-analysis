While it mentions using AI/ML and NLP for specific tools and features, these seem to be integrated into the existing software product rather than being the core focus of model development or deep AI research. The role is about building software that *uses* AI, not necessarily building the AI models themselves from scratch or specializing deeply in GenAI techniques. The emphasis is on software engineering with AI as an enhancement."

The AI/ML components are mentioned but are described as tools to enhance existing processes or features within the software. The profile assignment is strong, but a slightly higher score would require more explicit detail on the nature of the AI/ML tasks beyond 'NLP and machine learning'."
