            "rationale": "The job description focuses on using AI and automation for quality assurance and testing, rather than developing or engineering AI models or systems. While it mentions 'AI technology' and 'GenAI', the core tasks are related to test automation frameworks, dissecting test results, and ensuring software quality, which falls outside the scope of ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer roles as defined in the coding book. It is primarily a QA role enhanced by AI tools, fitting the 'Ambiguous' profile as it's not a technical AI development role."
