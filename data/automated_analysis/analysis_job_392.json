The presence of both macro-categories, with a clear focus on LLM technology, points towards a 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile, albeit at an internship level."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines both software development and specific LLM-related tasks. The mention of LLMs and the described activities are specific enough to confidently assign the profile. However, it's an internship description, so the depth of responsibility might be less than a full-time role, leading to a slightly less than perfect confidence score."
