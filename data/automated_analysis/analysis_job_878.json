The core responsibilities involve analyzing tickets, providing feedback to AI, and integrating existing AI capabilities, which aligns more with a user or enhancer of AI tools rather than a builder or engineer of AI systems. The role is primarily customer-facing and support-oriented, lacking the deep technical development, modeling, or MLOps components typically found in ML or GenAI Engineer roles."
