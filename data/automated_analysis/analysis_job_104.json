This team focuses on building and standardizing model dev experiences for ML Engineers and Data Scientists. We build and operate the dev tool known as Canvas, where ML engineers can develop the model solutions for their business needs in all critical ML phases, such as feature engineering, training, serving, ML-Ops, and monitoring. With the Canvas tool, users can iterate quickly and collaboratively during model dev time to build their ML solution, and the solution will be automatically scaled up to run robustly when it is deployed into production.\n\n   Now we are extending our modeling support to generative AI and large scale models.

While it mentions extending support to generative AI and large-scale models, the core focus remains on the platform and tools for ML engineers, aligning with the 'ML Engineer' profile's emphasis on building and maintaining production-grade systems for predictive models and MLOps. The mention of 'large scale models' and 'generative AI' in the context of extending existing ML platform capabilities, rather than building user-facing GenAI applications, leans towards the ML Engineer role."
