            "rationale": "The job description emphasizes building and optimizing AI-powered applications and services, integrating AI models and algorithms into .NET applications, and ensuring scalability and efficiency. While it mentions AI, the core focus on integrating models into existing .NET applications, ensuring scalability, and maintaining applications, along with the mention of 'AI models and algorithms' without specific generative AI techniques, leans more towards an ML Engineer role. The mention of 'AI researchers' suggests collaboration on model integration rather than core generative model development. The emphasis on .NET and Microsoft technologies also aligns with a traditional software engineering background applied to ML integration."
