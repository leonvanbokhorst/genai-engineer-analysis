While it mentions AI, ML, and LLM in passing as technologies used by the company, the core responsibilities of the role itself do not directly involve designing, developing, fine-tuning, or deploying models. Instead, the role seems to focus on applying financial and project management expertise within a company that utilizes these technologies."
