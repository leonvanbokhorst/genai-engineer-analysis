While LLM/RAG are mentioned, the emphasis on diverse ML applications and the lack of specific GenAI-focused frameworks (like LangChain) or tasks (like prompt engineering) points towards a traditional ML Engineer role that also incorporates LLM capabilities."

The mention of both traditional ML and LLM/RAG suggests a hybrid role, but the specific examples lean more towards traditional ML applications. The confidence is high, but not perfect, as the balance between traditional ML and GenAI could be interpreted slightly differently."
