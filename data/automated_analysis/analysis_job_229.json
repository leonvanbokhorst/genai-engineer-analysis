While it involves data modeling and performance tuning, it does not emphasize the development, training, or fine-tuning of predictive or generative AI models, nor the core software development of AI-powered applications. The role is more aligned with traditional data engineering and solution architecture within a specific platform (Databricks) rather than a specialized AI engineering role."
