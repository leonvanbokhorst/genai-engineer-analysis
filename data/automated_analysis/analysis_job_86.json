            "profile": "Ambiguous",
            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on client interaction, strategy, and the application of AI solutions rather than the hands-on development, fine-tuning, or deep technical implementation of AI models. While it mentions AI, it lacks specific details on core AI engineering tasks like model building, training, or advanced prompt engineering, leaning more towards a consultative and strategic role. The emphasis on 'architect and implement data driven strategies', 'aiding clients in recognizing and harnessing the value of AI', and 'thought leadership' points away from a specialized engineering profile and towards a more business-oriented or advisory role, which aligns with the 'Ambiguous' classification due to its primary focus on business and client value rather than deep technical AI development."
