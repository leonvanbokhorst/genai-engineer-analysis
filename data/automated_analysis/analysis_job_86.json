While it mentions 'data science and generative AI' as the domain of innovation, the core responsibilities and listed activities are predominantly software development and integration (Macro-Category A). There are no explicit tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). The role is about building and deploying solutions within the AI/GenAI space, rather than developing the AI models themselves."

The mention of 'generative AI' is in the context of the domain where these software solutions are applied, not as a core technical skill for model building. The emphasis on software development, deployment, CI/CD, and code libraries strongly points to an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."
