While generative models (LLMs, GPT) are mentioned, the core focus is on applying these to specific healthcare datasets, developing models, and integrating them into production systems. The tech stack (Python, PyTorch, DVC, Docker, Azure) and responsibilities like 'In-House AI Model Development' and 'MLOps Professionalization' align strongly with the definition and evidence profile of an ML Engineer, particularly in productionizing models and managing their lifecycle, rather than solely focusing on building user-facing applications with GenAI as the primary component."
