            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on data engineering, automation, and business process improvement within procurement. While it mentions 'data modelling', 'data science', and 'GenAI' as areas the team is engaged in, the specific tasks listed are primarily focused on automation of existing processes (content generation, market price data flow, Source-to-Contract) and data pipeline management. There is no clear indication of building, fine-tuning, or deploying generative models themselves, nor is there a strong emphasis on predictive modeling or MLOps for ML models. The role appears to be more of a data engineer/automation specialist with a business focus, rather than a dedicated ML or GenAI Engineer."
