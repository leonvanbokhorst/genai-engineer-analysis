        "reasoning": "The job ad is concise. While it clearly mentions 'generatieve AI services', the specific nature of the 'ML modellen' is not explicitly stated as generative. However, the overall context and the 'oog voor AI' title suggest a GenAI focus. The balance between software engineering (A) and AI specialization (B) tasks is evident, leading to a high confidence score."
