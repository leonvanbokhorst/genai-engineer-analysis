There are no mentions of traditional software engineering tasks (integration, deployment, operations) or core software development principles. Therefore, the role is best classified as a GenAI Specialist."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite specific about the generative AI tasks and the data sources. However, it lacks detail on the specific technologies or frameworks used beyond 'AI' and 'social API's', and it doesn't mention any software engineering aspects, which makes it lean heavily towards a specialist role but without the full picture of a 'Core GenAI Engineer'."
