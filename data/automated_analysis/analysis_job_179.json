            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on front-end development (Vue 3, web interface, user experience) and integrating AI features into the front-end. While it mentions AI technologies like LLMs and agentic AI, the core responsibilities and required skills are centered around building user interfaces rather than developing, fine-tuning, or deploying the AI models themselves. The role is more about consuming AI services through an interface than building the AI core. Therefore, it does not fit the 'ML Engineer' or 'GenAI Engineer' profiles, which require deep involvement in model development or advanced generative AI system architecture. It leans towards traditional software development with AI integration, making 'Ambiguous' the most appropriate classification as it's not a core AI engineering role but rather a role that utilizes AI services."
