            "rationale": "The job description emphasizes the development of an AI-powered security platform, focusing on leveraging AI models and algorithms to transform threat defense and response. While it mentions 'AI-powered security platform' and 'ML/GenAI', the core responsibilities lean towards architecting, implementing, and scaling security solutions, transforming human-driven processes to AI-driven ones, and developing scalable platforms and services. This aligns more closely with the 'ML Engineer' profile's focus on building and deploying predictive models for specific tasks (like threat detection and response) and productionizing them within a larger system, rather than the 'GenAI Engineer's focus on generative models and user-facing applications built on top of them. The emphasis is on enhancing existing security operations through AI, which is a strong indicator of predictive modeling and automation rather than generative content creation or complex agent development."
