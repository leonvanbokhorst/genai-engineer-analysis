While it mentions 'GenAI features' as a technology powering the devices, the core responsibilities and tasks are centered around security research, red-teaming, vulnerability discovery, and exploitability, which are not directly aligned with the core functions of an ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer as defined in the coding book. The role is primarily security-focused rather than AI development or deployment."
