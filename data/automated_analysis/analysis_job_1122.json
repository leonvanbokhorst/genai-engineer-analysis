While it involves AI, the core tasks are about application support and fine-tuning, which doesn't align with the core responsibilities of an ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer as defined in the coding book. The role is more about leveraging AI tools for a specific business function (customer support) rather than building AI-centric products or core AI systems."
