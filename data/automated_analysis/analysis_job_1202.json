While it mentions integrating generative AI solutions and writing machine learning algorithms, these appear to be enhancements to existing processes rather than the primary focus of the role. The core responsibilities are product development and management, with AI/ML being a component to be integrated and developed within that framework. There is no specific mention of GenAI Specialist tasks like prompt engineering or RAG, nor extensive traditional ML tasks. Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

The emphasis is more on the former, with AI/ML as a supporting element. The distinction between AI-Adjacent and Core roles is clear based on the described responsibilities. The confidence is high, but not perfect, as the depth of AI/ML involvement is not as detailed as in a 'Core' role."
