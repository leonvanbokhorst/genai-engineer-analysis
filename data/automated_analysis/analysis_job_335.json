        "rationale": "The job description focuses exclusively on tasks related to providing human feedback for training generative AI models, specifically LLMs that generate code. These tasks, such as crafting questions and evaluating AI-generated code, fall under Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization), specifically 1.B.3 (Data Engineering & Management). There are no tasks identified from Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering). The role's emphasis is on contributing expertise to the AI training process rather than building software applications."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is clear about the nature of the work (human feedback for AI training) and the domain (generative AI, LLMs). However, it lacks specific technology mentions and the 'software engineer' background might imply a broader scope than the described tasks. The classification of tasks into 1.B.3 is well-supported by the text."
