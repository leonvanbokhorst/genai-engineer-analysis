        "rationale": "The job ad heavily emphasizes traditional data engineering tasks (data pipelines, ETL/ELT, data warehousing, data lakes, data modeling, data quality) using tools like Python and PySpark. While it mentions AI models, NLP, embedding models, and generative AI, the core responsibilities and the majority of the tasks described fall under building and maintaining the data infrastructure that supports these models, rather than developing or fine-tuning the AI models themselves or focusing on GenAI-specific applications like RAG or prompt engineering. The role is described as a 'Machine Learning Engineer' but the tasks lean towards the data engineering foundation required for ML/AI, with a strong software engineering component in building and optimizing these systems. It's not a 'GenAI Specialist' because the focus isn't on generative model specifics, nor an 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' as the core is data engineering for ML/AI, not just integrating AI into a broader product. It's also not a 'Software Engineer' as AI/ML is central. The balance of tasks, with a strong emphasis on data engineering (1.B.3) and software engineering (1.A.1, 1.A.2) supporting ML/AI, points towards a 'Core ML Engineer' profile, albeit with a data engineering specialization within that."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite detailed regarding data engineering tasks and technologies. However, the mention of 'generative AI' is somewhat broad and not elaborated upon with specific tasks, which slightly reduces confidence in distinguishing between a traditional ML focus and a GenAI focus. The profile assignment is based on the overwhelming emphasis on data infrastructure and traditional ML/AI support rather than specific generative AI applications."
