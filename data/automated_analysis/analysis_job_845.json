        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on building and maintaining the infrastructure and tools for an ML platform (Macro-Category A tasks like platform design, CI/CD, monitoring, security). While it mentions collaborating with AI/ML researchers and enabling experiments, the core responsibility is engineering the platform itself, rather than developing or fine-tuning ML models (Macro-Category B tasks). Therefore, it fits the profile of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer who builds software that supports AI/ML functionalities."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to platform engineering and MLOps, with a strong emphasis on building and maintaining systems. It lacks specific details about direct ML model development or GenAI specialization, making the classification towards AI-Adjacent Software Engineer quite confident. However, a slightly higher score would require more explicit mention of the AI/ML models being used or developed on the platform."
