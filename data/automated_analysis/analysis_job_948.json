While it mentions 'generative AI models' and 'large language models', it does not describe the development, fine-tuning, or deployment of these models themselves. Instead, it emphasizes the use of AI tools for training and evaluation, which aligns with the definition of the 'Ambiguous' profile as a role primarily focused on the use of AI tools to enhance productivity or assist in tasks, rather than building or engineering AI systems."
