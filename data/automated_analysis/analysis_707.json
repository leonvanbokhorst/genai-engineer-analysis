While there's mention of 'fine-tuning' and 'prototyping AI tools', it lacks the depth and emphasis on algorithm development or core AI/ML model building required for ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer profiles. The primary function appears to be using AI to enhance customer resolutions, which leans towards AI-assisted workflows rather than deep AI engineering."
