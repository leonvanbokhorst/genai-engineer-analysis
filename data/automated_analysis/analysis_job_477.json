While there is mention of integrating outcomes into products and collaborating with engineering teams (Macro-Category A), the core focus remains on the research and development of the AI models themselves, particularly LLMs and NLP. There is no mention of traditional ML tasks, nor is the role described as primarily building software that *uses* AI; rather, it's about advancing the AI models themselves. Therefore, 'GenAI Specialist' is the most fitting profile."
