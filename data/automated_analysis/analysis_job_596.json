While it mentions data-driven steering and insights, it lacks specific details about building, training, or deploying AI/ML models, which are central to ML Engineer and GenAI Engineer roles. The emphasis is on data integration and repository creation rather than predictive or generative modeling. Therefore, it falls under the 'Ambiguous' category as it's not a clear technical AI/ML role but rather a data-focused business analyst or data engineer position."
