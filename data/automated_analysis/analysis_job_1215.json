We achieve this by collecting customer contact events across multiple channels, and processing/analysing them using various techniques (incl. but not limited to AI, GenAI, ML, and NLP). Our application is used by several hundreds of internal users, generating business value in the millions per year. The team is currently composed of a Product Owner and 3 Data Scientists, supported by external ML Engineers. In order to accelerate CCA's performance to near-real time, we are looking for talented Software/Data Engineers.\n\n    Responsibilities:\n\n   * Redesign and optimize our Kafka streaming components to reduce latency, increase throughput, and increase event consumption rate.\n\n   * Upgrading/Developing new components of a multilayered application to enable near real-time data processing.\n\n   * Monitor, maintain and debug all components daily to ensure stability and consistency.",
