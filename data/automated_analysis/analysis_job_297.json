        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on tasks related to training and evaluating generative AI models, specifically by crafting questions and evaluating code generated by these models. While it mentions 'experienced software engineer', the core responsibilities (1.B.1) are centered around AI model development and refinement, with no mention of traditional software engineering tasks like integration, deployment, or MLOps (Macro-Category A). The explicit mention of 'generative artificial intelligence models' and the nature of the tasks (training, evaluating code) point towards a specialization in GenAI rather than a balanced engineering role."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines tasks related to AI model training and evaluation. However, it lacks specific details on the technologies used or the depth of software engineering practices involved, which prevents a perfect score. The primary focus on AI model interaction and training is clear, leading to a high confidence in the 'GenAI Specialist' profile."
