            "rationale": "The job description focuses on using human feedback to train AI models by crafting questions and evaluating code. While it mentions 'generative AI models' and 'large language models', it does not involve the core engineering tasks of building, fine-tuning, or deploying these models. The role is more about providing data and feedback for training rather than engineering the AI systems themselves. Therefore, it falls under the 'Ambiguous' category as it primarily focuses on the use of AI tools for training and lacks the technical depth of an ML or GenAI Engineer."
