While it mentions 'generative AI and foundation models' as a future direction for the team, the core responsibilities and technologies described are not centered around building, fine-tuning, or deploying GenAI models themselves. Instead, it emphasizes developing cloud-based solutions, collaborating with engineering teams, and creating innovative products, which aligns more with a general software engineering role rather than a specialized GenAI Engineer."
