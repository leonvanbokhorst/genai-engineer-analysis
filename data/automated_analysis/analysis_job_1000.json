            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on infrastructure automation, cloud engineering, and developer experience, which are core to a Platform Engineer role. While it mentions collaboration and learning new technologies, it does not contain specific keywords or responsibilities related to Machine Learning, Generative AI, model development, or data science that would align with the ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer profiles. The role appears to be a traditional infrastructure/DevOps focused position, making it fall under the 'Ambiguous' category as per the coding book's definition for non-AI technical roles."
