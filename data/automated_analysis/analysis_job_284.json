It also includes data engineering aspects supporting AI initiatives. The presence of explicit Generative AI projects, alongside foundational infrastructure and data management, points towards a balanced role focused on GenAI, fitting the 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile."

While the exact nature of 'GenAI Suite' and 'Klus Coach' isn't detailed, their explicit mention as generative AI projects is strong evidence. The inclusion of data pipelines and server management solidifies the software engineering aspect. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the depth of involvement in pure model development vs. integration isn't fully specified."
