            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on pre-sales activities, customer relationship building, and demonstrating a platform's capabilities. While it mentions data engineering, data science, and ML, it does not detail the core responsibilities of building, training, or deploying models or generative AI systems. The emphasis is on advising on architecture and design, authoring reference architectures, and hands-on evaluation with Spark programming, which aligns more with a pre-sales technical advisor role rather than a dedicated ML or GenAI Engineer. The role is primarily about selling a platform's capabilities rather than developing AI solutions from scratch."
