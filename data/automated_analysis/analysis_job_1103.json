While it mentions LLMs and specific AI technologies, the core responsibilities are centered around software development, integration, and operational support (1.A.1). The mention of 'creating an assistant' hints at prompt engineering (1.B.2), but the overall emphasis is on the engineering and integration aspects rather than deep model development or specialization. The role aims to boost the company's innovation capacity by applying these AI technologies, positioning it as a software engineer role that heavily utilizes AI, rather than a pure AI specialist."

The profile assignment is strongly supported by the evidence, with a clear emphasis on the 'Software Development & Integration' category. A slightly lower score is given because 'creating an assistant' could be interpreted as more specialized, but the overall context leans towards integration."
