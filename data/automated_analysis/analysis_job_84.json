While it mentions supporting development and deployment of ML models and implementing libraries, there is no mention of Generative AI specific tasks like LLMs, RAG, or prompt engineering. The tasks are predominantly related to traditional ML model lifecycle management and software engineering practices supporting it. Therefore, it aligns best with a 'Core ML Engineer' profile."
