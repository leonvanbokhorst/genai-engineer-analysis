While it mentions 'prompt engineering' (1.B.2), the majority of the responsibilities fall under traditional software engineering activities like training, beta testing, liaison between users and technical teams, monitoring, troubleshooting, and using feedback for product development (all classified under 1.A.1). There is no mention of core model development, fine-tuning, or advanced AI/ML research. The role is about integrating and supporting AI solutions rather than building them from the ground up. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to customer success and support for AI products. The tasks are predominantly in the 'Software Development & Integration' category, with a specific mention of prompt engineering. The distinction between this role and a core AI/ML engineer is clear. The confidence is high, but not perfect (5), as the role is customer-facing and support-oriented, which is a slight variation from a pure 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' who might be more directly involved in the product's technical integration within the company's own systems rather than external customer systems."
