The provided CODING_BOOK is specifically designed for analyzing GenAI Engineer roles and defines its task categories (Macro-Category A and B) within the context of AI/ML. The job ad contains no mention of AI, Machine Learning, Generative AI, LLMs, or related concepts. Consequently, none of the tasks described in the ad can be semantically mapped to the definitions of the task categories in the CODING_BOOK, as these definitions inherently require an AI/ML domain context. Therefore, the role is not relevant to the scope of this analysis."
