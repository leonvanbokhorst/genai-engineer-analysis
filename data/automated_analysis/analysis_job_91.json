It also highlights data pipeline management and data governance for these models. While there's mention of 'AI-powered experiences' and 'work experiences', the core focus is on the underlying model development and research rather than integrating these models into existing software products. There are no explicit mentions of traditional software engineering tasks like building microservices or product code. Therefore, the role leans towards specialization in GenAI rather than a balanced engineering role or an AI-adjacent software engineering role."
