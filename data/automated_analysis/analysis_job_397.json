We are curious generalists who don't pigeon-hole ourselves as particular \"flavors\" of engineer and never say \"that's not my job\".\n     * Collaborate with customers through full engagements; you'll learn about their business challenges, rapidly design and develop prototypes to solve them, showcase the functionality you've written in demos and finally see the difference you've made when customers deploy solutions into their production environments.\n     * Work with the latest AWS services and open-source technologies to build your prototypes. You'll always be encouraged to pick the right tools for the job.\n\n   About the team\n   We are a team of problem-solvers and builders who work on our customer's challenges that don't have cookie-cutter solutions. We work with the latest 5G and GenAI technologies and partner with leaders in these spaces. We often don't have the answers right away, and are expected to Dive Deep to figure out the best approach.

            "rationale": "The job description emphasizes a broad range of software development disciplines including back-end, front-end, networking, DevOps, machine learning, and data science. While it mentions 'GenAI technologies' and 'machine learning', it does not go into sufficient detail about specific generative AI tasks, model fine-tuning, RAG systems, or LLM frameworks to classify it as a 'GenAI Engineer'. Similarly, it lacks the specific focus on predictive modeling and MLOps required for an 'ML Engineer'. The role appears to be a generalist software development role that *uses* AI technologies rather than specializing in their development or deployment, fitting the 'Ambiguous' profile."
