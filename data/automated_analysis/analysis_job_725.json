While it mentions generative AI, the emphasis is on using and promoting these tools, identifying solutions, and collaborating with legal teams, aligning more with a business or application-focused role rather than a core engineering role in ML or GenAI development. The tasks are centered around understanding business needs, advising on tools, and managing their implementation, which fits the 'Ambiguous' profile's criteria for roles primarily focused on the use of AI tools to enhance productivity."
