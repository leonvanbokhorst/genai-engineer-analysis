While it mentions AI/ML fields like NLP, time series modeling, and image recognition, these are presented as areas of application for data engineering rather than core AI model development or GenAI specialization.

However, the specific AI/ML tasks are mentioned broadly without deep dives into model development or GenAI specifics, making it lean towards the 'AI-Adjacent' profile rather than a specialized AI role. The confidence is high due to the clarity of the software engineering aspects, but not maximum due to the general mention of AI fields."
