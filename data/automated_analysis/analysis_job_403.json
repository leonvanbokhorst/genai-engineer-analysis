While generative AI is not explicitly mentioned, the core responsibilities align with the 'ML Engineer' profile's focus on data engineering, modeling (implied through 'MLOps pipelines' and 'data resource creation'), and operations engineering (MLOps) within a cloud environment (GCP). The mention of 'MLOps pipelines' and 'DevOps approach to Data Engineering' strongly points towards this profile over a GenAI Engineer."
