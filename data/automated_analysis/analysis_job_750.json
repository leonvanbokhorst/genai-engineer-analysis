While it mentions 'GenAI Acceleration Team' and 'AI solutions', it lacks specific details about core AI/ML tasks such as model development, fine-tuning, or deep involvement with generative models. The responsibilities listed are general engineering tasks rather than specialized AI engineering roles. Therefore, it does not fit the criteria for ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer and is classified as Ambiguous."
