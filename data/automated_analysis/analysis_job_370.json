            "profile": "Ambiguous",
            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on traditional data engineering tasks such as data pipeline development, ETL processes, data processing, and data governance. While it mentions integrating Generative AI solutions and collaborating with Azure OpenAI Services, these appear to be secondary to the core data engineering responsibilities. The role does not demonstrate a primary focus on building, fine-tuning, or deploying generative models themselves, nor does it emphasize core ML engineering tasks like algorithm development or predictive modeling. Therefore, it does not fit the 'ML Engineer' or 'GenAI Engineer' profiles and is classified as 'Ambiguous' due to its primary focus on data engineering with AI integration rather than AI development itself."
