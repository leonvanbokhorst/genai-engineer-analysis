            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on content creation, copywriting, and the application of AI tools for marketing purposes, rather than the development, fine-tuning, or deployment of AI models. While prompt engineering is mentioned, it's in the context of using existing generative AI tools for content generation and workflow optimization, not building AI systems. The core responsibilities and technologies described do not align with the core tasks of an ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer as defined in the coding book. The role appears to be primarily business-focused and centered around the use of AI tools for productivity enhancement."
