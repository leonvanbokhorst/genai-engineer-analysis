            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on content creation and prompt engineering for marketing purposes, rather than the development, fine-tuning, or deployment of generative AI models or traditional ML models. While it mentions generative AI tools and prompt engineering, it lacks the core technical responsibilities and technologies associated with ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer profiles, such as algorithm development, model training, MLOps, or building production-grade software systems. The emphasis is on using AI tools for content generation and workflow optimization, which aligns with the 'use of AI tools to enhance productivity' criterion for the Ambiguous profile."
