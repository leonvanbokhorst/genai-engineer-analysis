            "rationale": "The job description emphasizes designing, developing, and optimizing data pipelines, integrating GenAI into analytics workflows, and supporting the deployment of machine learning models. While GenAI is mentioned, the core focus on data pipelines, advanced analytics, and supporting ML model deployment aligns more closely with the responsibilities of an ML Engineer, particularly the 'Data Engineering' and 'Modeling' aspects, with a secondary focus on 'Operations Engineering (MLOps)' for model deployment. The role is less about building user-facing applications with GenAI and more about the underlying data and model infrastructure for analytics."
