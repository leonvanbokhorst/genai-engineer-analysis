        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on software development and integration tasks within the Salesforce ecosystem (Macro-Category A), specifically mentioning 'Automating Salesforce and CPQ Configurations' and 'CI/CD Pipeline Management'. While it mentions 'AI-driven solutions', it does not detail specific AI/ML model development, fine-tuning, or GenAI-specific tasks (Macro-Category B). The role appears to be about integrating AI capabilities into existing business processes and systems rather than developing core AI models. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is reasonably clear about the core responsibilities being software development and automation within the Salesforce platform. However, the mention of 'AI-driven solutions' is somewhat vague and lacks specific details about the AI technologies or methodologies involved, which prevents a perfect score."
