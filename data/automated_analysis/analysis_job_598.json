            "rationale": "The job description focuses on a Full Stack Developer role integrating existing services and AI solutions into a conversational AI platform. While it mentions Generative AI and LLM-based Advisor Assist, the core responsibilities and tasks described lean heavily towards traditional software development, platform enhancement, and integration rather than the core development, fine-tuning, or deep specialization in generative models characteristic of a GenAI Engineer. The role appears to be more about utilizing AI tools and integrating AI solutions into existing systems, which aligns with the 'Ambiguous' profile's definition of primarily focusing on the use of AI tools to enhance productivity or traditional software engineering."
