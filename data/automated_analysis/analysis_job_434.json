            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on the use of AI as a tool to enhance existing software development processes and productivity, rather than on the core development, fine-tuning, or deployment of AI models themselves. Phrases like 'AI as their co-pilot', 'elevating your coding skills', 'crafting AI tools that clarify complex concepts', and 'AI as our guide' suggest an emphasis on AI-assisted development and productivity gains, which aligns with the definition of the 'Ambiguous' profile. There is a lack of specific technical details regarding AI model development, MLOps, or deep generative AI techniques that would point towards an ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer profile."
