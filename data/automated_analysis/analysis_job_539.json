It also focuses on data management, reproducibility, infrastructure automation, CI/CD for ML, and optimizing performance of implemented solutions. While it mentions Python and ML libraries, the core focus is on the operational and engineering aspects of machine learning models rather than the development of generative AI applications or advanced prompt engineering, which are hallmarks of a GenAI Engineer. The role is about ensuring ML models are reliable and performant in production, aligning with the definition of an ML Engineer."
