            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on general software engineering principles, multidisciplinary teamwork, and soft skills development. While it mentions 'generative AI' as a training area, it does not specify any core responsibilities or required technologies related to building, fine-tuning, or deploying generative AI models. The role appears to be a general software engineering position that offers training in AI, rather than a role that requires direct experience or expertise in GenAI engineering."
