The core responsibilities involve 'helping train AI models', 'crafting and answering questions related to computer science in order to help train AI models', and 'evaluating and ranking code generated by AI models'. These tasks fall under Macro-Category B: GenAI Specialization, specifically 'Model Development & Fine-Tuning' (1.B.1). There are no tasks mentioned from Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering). Therefore, the role is best classified as a specialist focused on the AI model development aspect, fitting the 'ML Specialist (Data Scientist)' profile, with a focus on GenAI tasks."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the core tasks related to AI model training and evaluation. However, it lacks specific details about the technologies used or the depth of involvement in model architecture or fine-tuning beyond data provision and evaluation. The profile assignment is strong based on the task descriptions, but the lack of technical specifics prevents a perfect score."
