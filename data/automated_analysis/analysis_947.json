While it mentions 'software engineer' and 'coding expertise', it lacks specific details about building AI systems, RAG, or fine-tuning, which are core to a GenAI Engineer. It also does not align with the core responsibilities of an ML Engineer. The role appears more focused on data annotation and feedback for AI training rather than core engineering of AI systems."
