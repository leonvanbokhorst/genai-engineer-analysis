Here, AI is at the heart of everything we do: from brainstorming features to detecting bugs, fixing defects, and optimizing performance. We don't just flirt with AI tools; we embed AI into every phase of development to cut waste, speed up delivery, and build with precision.\n\n   In this role, you'll transform existing B2B products into cloud-native applications with AI enhancements at every stage. You'll develop and launch AI-powered features, utilizing cutting-edge retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for automated bug detection, ensuring seamless releases without outages or disruptions. If you're seeking a role where architecture debates take precedence over shipping, this isn't it.\n\n   If you're eager to push the boundaries of AI-driven software engineering and catapult your career into large-scale cloud-native development, apply now.

            "profile": "Ambiguous",
            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on the application of AI tools and AI-driven features within a software development context, rather than the core development, fine-tuning, or deployment of generative models themselves. While it mentions RAG and AI development agents, it lacks depth in the specific technical requirements for building or deeply customizing these AI components, leaning more towards using AI to enhance existing software engineering processes. The primary focus remains on C# Software Development and cloud-native applications, with AI as an enhancement rather than the core technology being engineered. This aligns with the 'Ambiguous' profile's definition of roles that primarily focus on the USE of AI tools to enhance productivity or are traditional software engineering roles with AI integration."
