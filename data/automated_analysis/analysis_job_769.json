This aligns with the `Software Engineer` profile, which is defined as having tasks exclusively from Macro-Category A and not involving AI/ML."

        "reasoning": "The job advertisement is extremely brief, providing only a title. This lack of detail makes it impossible to perform a thorough analysis against the detailed categories of the `CODING_BOOK.md`. The classification of the profile and the identification of technologies are based solely on the title and the absence of AI/ML keywords, leading to very low confidence."
