Important aspects of your job on a day-to-day basis will be to:\n     * Work on prediction models, which are used in KLM live customer interactions 24/7. These models help our customers getting the right product and service for them.\n     * Meet with stakeholders and subject matter experts to gain a better understanding of the underlying business problem and the requirements;\n     * Perform exploratory data analysis to assess data quality and gain important insights;\n     * Research and choose an appropriate set of potential models and loss functions that align with the problem and discuss validation strategies with your fellow data scientists;\n     * Perform feature engineering, be creative and combine new sources with the traditional data warehouses or our vast data lakes to increase model performance;\n     * Execute experiments while logging your model's metrics, parameters and metadata to a model registry for easy sharing and reproducibility;\n     * Put your model into production, and work together with engineers inside and outside of the team to ensure company-wide production standards are met;\n     * Maintain and/or improve your model through monitoring, re-training, adding new features etc.;\n     * Guide our upcoming transition to the cloud: Identify requirements and improvements, communicate them to relevant parties;\n     * Determine how Data Science requirements translate to architectural components and way of working;\n     * Share your greatest lessons at one of the community events\n     * Have fun and enjoy while you are doing it!\n\n   You are also encouraged and expected to spend 15-20% of your time with us learning new things, doing research and developing yourself. You can do this by follouowing crses, reading papers or doing cool hack projects with your colleagues. The projects you do in your 15-20% developing time must be related to your role, but do not have to be related to the projects you normally work on.\n\n   Do you have what it takes to take KLM's data-driven decision-making to a higher level?\n\n   Waar land je?\n\n   You will be working in a hybrid way, partially from home and partially from the office at the headquarters of KLM in Amstelveen.

You will be working in a hybrid way, partially from home and partially from the office at the headquarters of KLM in Amstelveen. We have flexible working hours and office days; hence we will find something that suits you. You will be hired by the Data, OR & AI department, which will place you into one of the Data Science product teams in KLM (i.e. a matrix organization). The OR department currently comprises about 40 Data Science professionals in product teams across KLM, sharing knowledge, training and (social) events. Across all expertise, we are growing and in search of new talent so we can scale the AI capabilities at KLM.\n\n   The Finance Data Analytics (FDA) team currently consists of multiple Data Scientists, who work closely with our contacts in the business. The FDA team is part of a larger value chain embedded in their part of the organization, meaning you will also work closely together with other data teams that are specialized in areas like Data Engineering and Data Governance. The core focus of the FDA team is improving decision making in financial processes around KLM.

While Generative AI is mentioned in the context of specific financial use cases (e.g., preventing revenue leakage), the core responsibilities and required skills align more closely with traditional ML Engineering, focusing on data engineering, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and MLOps for predictive systems. The role involves building and maintaining production-grade systems for predictive modeling, which is a hallmark of an ML Engineer."
