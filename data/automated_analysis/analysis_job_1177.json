While it mentions 'Machine learning' and 'Data Science tooling' as bonus points, the core responsibilities and emphasis are on technical leadership, strategic direction, and enabling other engineers, which aligns with a role that primarily uses AI tools to enhance productivity or is a technical leadership role not directly focused on AI model creation. It does not fit the core definitions of ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer."
