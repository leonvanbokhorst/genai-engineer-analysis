The core responsibilities involve analyzing tickets, providing feedback on AI solutions, and prototyping new AI tools, which aligns more with the use of AI for productivity enhancement rather than core AI development. There is no evidence of core ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer tasks such as algorithm development, model training, RAG system building, or fine-tuning LLMs in a development capacity. The role is primarily technical support with an AI augmentation component."
