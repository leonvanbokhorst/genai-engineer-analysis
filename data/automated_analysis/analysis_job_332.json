It mentions 'AI Trainer' but does not elaborate on the nature of the training or the AI models involved. The core focus appears to be on 'Full Stack Developer' with a mention of AI, but without sufficient technical depth to classify it as an ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer. It could be interpreted as using AI tools for productivity or a role that is not primarily technical."
