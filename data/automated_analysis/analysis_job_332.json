Software Development & Integration) and Macro-Category B ('AI Trainer' -> 1.B.1. Model Development & Fine-Tuning). This indicates a balanced mix of core software engineering and AI specialization tasks. The term 'AI Trainer' is interpreted as leaning towards modern AI/GenAI, as this is a common connotation in the current tech landscape. Therefore, the Core GenAI Engineer profile is assigned."

This makes a precise classification challenging, particularly in distinguishing between traditional ML and GenAI aspects based solely on the term 'AI Trainer'."
