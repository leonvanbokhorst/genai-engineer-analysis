            "profile": "Ambiguous",
            "rationale": "The job description emphasizes software engineering leadership, project delivery, and adaptability, with GenAI knowledge being a 'bonus' rather than a core requirement. While it mentions 'GenAI components' and 'GenAI technologies,' the focus is on the delivery and integration of software products, not the deep technical development, fine-tuning, or deployment of generative models themselves. The role seems to be more about managing the delivery of solutions that *may* involve GenAI, rather than being a hands-on GenAI specialist. This aligns with the 'Ambiguous' profile, which is for roles that are not primarily technical AI roles or focus on the *use* of AI tools for productivity."
