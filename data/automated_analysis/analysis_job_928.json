While the company uses generative AI and automation, the role itself does not involve developing, fine-tuning, or deploying AI models. It focuses on manual testing, defect management, and ensuring software quality, which falls outside the scope of ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer profiles. The role primarily focuses on the *use* of AI-powered tools and platforms rather than the engineering of AI itself."
