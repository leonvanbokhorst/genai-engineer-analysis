            "profile": "Ambiguous",
            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on traditional software engineering, project leadership, and stakeholder management. While it mentions 'Advanced Analytics', it lacks specific details about AI/ML model development, generative AI techniques, or the core responsibilities associated with ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer profiles. The emphasis is on translating business requirements, technical reviews, integration, and team leadership, which are general engineering and management tasks rather than specialized AI roles. Therefore, it falls under the 'Ambiguous' category as it's not a clear technical AI role."
