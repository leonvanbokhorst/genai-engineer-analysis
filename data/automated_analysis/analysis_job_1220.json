            "rationale": "The job description focuses on cloud computing, platform engineering, and MLOps/data engineering enablement, but does not involve the core development or fine-tuning of AI models themselves. While it mentions piloting emerging technologies like GenAI and Machine Learning, the primary responsibilities are centered around building and operating cloud infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines, rather than being a specialist in AI model development or application. Therefore, it falls under the 'Ambiguous' category as it's a technical role but not directly an AI specialist role as defined by the other profiles."
