While there is a mention of integrating AI solutions into business processes (1.A.1), the core responsibilities (1.B.1) are predominantly in traditional ML model development. There are no explicit mentions of Generative AI specific tasks like LLMs, RAG, or prompt engineering. The soft skills identified (communication, learning) are supportive but do not shift the core focus. Therefore, the 'ML Specialist (Data Scientist)' profile is the most appropriate."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the tasks involved, primarily focusing on traditional ML model development and experimentation. The language is specific enough to categorize the tasks accurately. However, it lacks explicit mention of specific tools or technologies, which would have increased confidence to a 5. The distinction between traditional ML and GenAI is clear from the described tasks."
