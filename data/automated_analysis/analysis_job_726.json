While DeepL is an AI company, this specific role is for a 'Full Stack Software Developer' within their 'Business Technology' team, emphasizing enterprise-grade software development, session management, account management, and billing. The core responsibilities and required technical proficiencies (C#, frontend/backend development) do not align with the specialized tasks of an ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer as defined in the Coding Book. The role is more about building and maintaining business-critical software that *uses* AI technologies rather than developing or engineering AI models themselves. Therefore, it falls under the 'Ambiguous' category due to its primary focus on traditional software engineering with AI as a secondary benefit."
