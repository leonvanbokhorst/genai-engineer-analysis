While it mentions developing and deploying machine learning models and AI algorithms, it lacks specific details about generative AI, LLMs, RAG, or fine-tuning, which are hallmarks of a GenAI Engineer. The core responsibilities and technologies described align more with a general software engineering or MLOps role rather than a specialized ML or GenAI Engineer. The role is primarily about building and maintaining a platform, with AI/ML as a component rather than the central focus."
