While it mentions understanding business needs and quality, these are in the context of software engineering tasks. There is no mention of AI, ML, LLMs, or generative models. The technologies listed (Tosca, Playwright, Selenium, Robot Framework) are standard test automation tools, not AI/ML specific. Therefore, the role is classified as a 'Software Engineer' as it involves core software development practices without any AI/ML specialization."
