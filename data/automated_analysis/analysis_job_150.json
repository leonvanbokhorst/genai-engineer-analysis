It highlights core responsibilities such as building RAG systems (implied by document interaction), fine-tuning LLMs (implied by experimenting with new AI technologies), and developing complex agents (implied by working on use cases from idea to production and coordinating the full project lifecycle). The role involves significant software development to integrate these AI capabilities into user-facing systems and MLOps for production deployment. While ML concepts are present, the primary focus is on generative models and their application in user-facing products, aligning strongly with the GenAI Engineer profile."
