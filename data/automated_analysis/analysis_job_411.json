While leadership and strategy are present, the core technical responsibility is building and executing the software. There are no specific mentions of AI model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG, indicating the AI aspect is more about using existing AI capabilities within the platform rather than developing the AI models themselves. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

However, it lacks specific details about the AI technologies or methodologies used, making it impossible to classify the AI tasks more granularly. The emphasis is on the software engineering and leadership aspects of building an AI-powered product."
