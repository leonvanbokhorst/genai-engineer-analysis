    "profile": {
        "assigned_profile": "ML Specialist (Data Scientist)",
        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on tasks related to training and evaluating AI models, specifically generative AI models. Phrases like 'help train generative artificial intelligence models', 'engaging with these models as they learn to code', 'Crafting and answering questions related to computer science in order to help train AI models', and 'Evaluating and ranking code generated by AI models' all fall under Macro-Category B: GenAI Specialization. There are no tasks mentioned that fall under Macro-Category A: Core Software Engineering (e.g., building applications, MLOps, CI/CD). Therefore, the role is predominantly focused on the AI specialization aspect, leading to the 'ML Specialist (Data Scientist)' profile, as the tasks are about model training and evaluation rather than software development."
    },
    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines tasks related to training and evaluating AI models. While it mentions 'experienced software engineer', the core responsibilities described are squarely within AI model specialization (Macro-Category B) and lack any mention of traditional software engineering tasks (Macro-Category A). This makes the classification straightforward, but the 'Senior Developer Mentor' title and the mention of 'software engineer' could imply a broader scope not fully detailed in this excerpt, hence not a perfect 5."
