While it mentions AI-related fields like NLP, time series modeling, and image recognition, these are listed as project areas rather than core responsibilities for the role itself. The role is described as 'Data Engineer/developer' and emphasizes integration into existing systems and client-facing solutions, aligning with Macro-Category A. There is no explicit mention of generative AI tasks or specific GenAI tools. Therefore, it fits the 'Software Engineer' profile, as it's primarily a software development role that may touch upon AI domains but doesn't center on AI model development or integration."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering responsibilities and mentions AI fields as project contexts. However, it lacks specific details about the AI/ML tasks or technologies involved, making it slightly less definitive than an ad explicitly detailing AI model work. The profile assignment is strong based on the emphasis on traditional software engineering."
