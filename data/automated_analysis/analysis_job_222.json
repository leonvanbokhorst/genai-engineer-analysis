        "rationale": "The job ad heavily emphasizes traditional software engineering tasks such as architecting, implementing, and scaling features, leading technical discussions, and making technical decisions. While it mentions 'AI-powered education' and 'AI learning copilot', it does not detail specific AI/ML model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG implementation. The focus is on integrating AI into the product as a feature, rather than the core development of the AI models themselves. Therefore, the role is classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, primarily falling under Macro-Category A with AI as a domain."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering responsibilities and the domain (AI in education). However, it lacks specific details about the AI technologies or methodologies to be used, making it impossible to classify any tasks under Macro-Category B. The confidence is high for the software engineering aspects but moderate for the precise AI integration details."
