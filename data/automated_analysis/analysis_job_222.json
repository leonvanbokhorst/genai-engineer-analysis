We're seeking a Senior Quality Assurance Automation Engineer who can harness the power of AI to crush bugs before they're born and accelerate release cycles beyond what traditional methods can achieve.\n\n   Imagine a world where 60% of software bugs aren't discovered post-release, and the industry doesn't lose $2 trillion annually to quality defects. That's the future we're building at IgniteTech, and we need your expertise to make it a reality. We're integrating cutting-edge GenAI tools into every facet of our QA process, and we're looking for a visionary who can lead this charge.\n\n   This isn't your grandfather's QA role. If you're content with manual testing or writing the same automation scripts day in and day out, look elsewhere. We're after someone who can architect AI-driven frameworks, deploy predictive analytics, and shape the future of software quality. Ready to be at the forefront of the QA revolution? Your keyboard awaits.\n\n   What you will be doing\n\n     * Pioneer AI-powered test automation frameworks that generate comprehensive test cases, scripts, and data with unprecedented efficiency\n     * Leverage GenAI tools to conduct deep analysis of testing outcomes, uncover hidden defect patterns, and drive continuous improvement\n     * Design and implement AI-driven simulations of user scenarios, stress conditions, and edge cases to preemptively identify and neutralize potential issues\n\n   What you will NOT be doing\n\n     * Manually executing repetitive test cases that could be automated\n     * Writing basic automation scripts without leveraging AI capabilities\n     * Waiting for bugs to be reported by users or other teams\n     * Focusing solely on functional testing without considering performance, security, or user experience, Drive the integration of AI and automation tools to dramatically accelerate product releases while significantly reducing defect rates, revolutionizing our approach to software quality assurance.",
