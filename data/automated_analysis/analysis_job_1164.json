Join the education revolution at 2 Hour Learning!\n\n   At 2 Hour Learning, we're not just talking about transforming education - we're proving it with hard data. Our learning ecosystem harnesses cutting-edge AI, learning science, and psychometrics to create a digital learning environment that's twice as effective as traditional schooling. High schoolers ace AP exams, middle schoolers advance 2 grade levels per year, and even kindergarteners shatter learning goals.\n\n   You'll play a pivotal role in architecting this AI-powered learning revolution. You'll wield autonomy and creative freedom to envision, code, and ship sophisticated full-stack applications and interactive AI tools that engage students and drive learning efficiency to unprecedented heights.\n\n   This isn't a role for AI dabblers or back-end-only coders. We seek bold AI architects who can seamlessly weave AI magic across front-end interfaces, back-end algorithms, and end-to-end product experiences. You'll own and optimize the entire product lifecycle, partnering closely with stakeholders to ensure we're nailing learner needs., * Continually experimenting with and integrating the latest generative AI tech to pioneer novel educational experiences\n     * Owning end-to-end product lifecycle, from gathering requirements to development, launch and iterative enhancement\n     * Partnering with stakeholders to align development with learner needs and garner insights to fuel cycles of innovation\n     * Leveraging AI-driven automation across testing, debugging and beyond to maximize development velocity and robustness\n\n   What you will NOT be doing\n\n     * Coding narrow AI features in isolation of overarching product goals and learner needs\n     * Implementing AI in a superficial, \"buzzwordy\" way that doesn't drive material learning gains\n     * Toiling away at small-scale internal demos; your applications will drive learning impact for thousands\n     * Waiting for others to define product requirements or conduct user research; you'll lead the charge\n     * Wasting hours on manual QA; you'll leverage AI-powered testing to maximize efficiency, Develop and deliver engaging, human-centered AI applications that demonstrably accelerate learning outcomes and efficiency for thousands of K-12 students.",
