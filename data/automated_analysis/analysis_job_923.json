            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on traditional software development, data engineering (ETL, data processing), and MLOps principles within a banking context. While it mentions 'big data' and 'calculations', there is no explicit mention of machine learning models, generative AI, or predictive analytics. The core responsibilities revolve around building and maintaining data pipelines, software applications, and deployment infrastructure, which aligns more with a traditional software engineer or data engineer role rather than an ML or GenAI Engineer. The mention of 'DEV Engineer Java' and technologies like Java, Oracle, Linux, and Kafka further reinforces this. Therefore, it does not fit the criteria for ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer and is classified as Ambiguous as it's a technical role but not specifically AI/ML focused."
