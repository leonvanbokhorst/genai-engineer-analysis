While it mentions 'generative AI' as an example of innovation and a 'new writing product' being developed in-house, the core responsibilities described are centered around building, maintaining, and integrating features into a platform, along with infrastructure migration and testing. There are no specific tasks or deep dives into generative AI model development, prompt engineering, or RAG systems. The role is about integrating AI as a feature, not specializing in AI/ML itself. Therefore, it aligns best with the 'Software Engineer' profile, which involves building or maintaining software that uses AI/ML features as a core part of its functionality, but without a primary focus on the AI/ML aspects themselves."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines traditional software development responsibilities and technologies. The mention of generative AI is brief and contextualized as an example of innovation rather than a core technical requirement. The primary focus remains on PHP development and platform growth. The confidence is high, but not perfect (5), because the mention of 'generative AI' could imply a deeper involvement than explicitly stated, though the overall description leans heavily towards a software engineering role."
