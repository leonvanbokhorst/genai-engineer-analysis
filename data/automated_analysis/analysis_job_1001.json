Phrases like 'help train AI models', 'train generative artificial intelligence models', 'engaging with these models as they learn to code', 'Crafting and answering questions related to computer science in order to help train AI models', and 'Evaluating and ranking code generated by AI models' all fall under Macro-Category B: GenAI Specialization, specifically 'Model Development & Fine-Tuning' (1.B.1). There are no tasks mentioned that fall under Macro-Category A: Core Software Engineering. The role is described as freelance and remote with flexible hours, and explicitly states 'no requirement for previous AI experience', indicating a focus on the AI/ML task itself rather than software engineering integration or MLOps. Therefore, the profile is 'ML Specialist (Data Scientist)' as the tasks are predominantly focused on the AI/ML model development and evaluation aspects."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is clear about the core tasks involving AI model training and evaluation. However, it lacks detail on specific technologies or the depth of involvement in model development beyond data generation and evaluation. The profile assignment is strongly indicated by the task descriptions, but the absence of software engineering tasks prevents it from being a 'Core GenAI Engineer'. The confidence is high but not perfect due to the limited scope of technical details provided."
