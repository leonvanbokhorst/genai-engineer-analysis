You are used to working in a fast-paced start-up environment. You will have experience with the software development life cycle, from ideation through implementation, to testing and release.\n\n       You will join a group of more than 40 Engineers in the R&D department and will have the opportunity to collaborate with multiple research teams across diverse areas, our R&D research is guided by our co-founders - Prof. Lourdes Agapito, Prof. Matthias Niessner and Director of Science Vittorio Ferrari.\n\n   If you know and love LLMs, or have experience fine tuning LLMs with additional modalities - then we would love to talk to you. We will also want to talk to you - if that's what you dream of doing.  \n\nWhat will you be doing?\n\n     Our NLP team is working on creating a virtual director that will automatically generate the best video and best avatar performance based on the context of a user script. Very much like the real world where a director can help create a powerful performance by directing the actors and guiding other aspects of the video. The team is focused on extracting cues from a large pool of proprietary video and audio data in order to train a virtual director. The findings within the NLP team are very important in driving the direction for other teams within the R&D.\n\n   In this position, you'll join the team to help train LLMs for text or multi-modal tasks that will help us create human-like avatars and effective powerful videos. You will also help us create high quality, production ready code and take ownership of production pipelines. This would include:\n     * Assist in finding and collecting appropriate data for the tasks.\n     * Make sure we have correct pipelines in place to ingest data from existing processed data, text, voice and video and adjust granularity.\n     * Analyse and pre-process data if necessary.\n     * Help define and run experimentation to facilitate predicting emotion signals from different architecture choices of the adapted LLM.\n     * Take hypotheses, ideas or papers and create implementations of solutions on the back of these\n     * Run experiments on the back of the created implementations that evaluate and verify hypotheses\n     * Contribute to a high-quality codebase, develop tests where necessary, and participate in code reviews.\n     * Help a team of research engineers, scientists and linguists to write clean and efficient code, and define best practices\n     * Developing production quality software, our teams work \"full stack\" with the ability to deliver direct to product and impact the world., You will work in a hybrid setting with an office in Amsterdam",
