The team handles complex challenges and works on innovative and often AI focused projects while controlling and directing other engineering teams, external partners and stakeholders. The role is essential in providing our audience a great experience every time they open the VIX app and will be key to developing industry-leading reliability, quality, and performance.\n\n   In this role, as part of the R&D team, you will work closely with stakeholders in understanding what the business needs and translate that into technical requirements for research and development.
