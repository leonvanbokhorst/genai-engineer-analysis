The team handles complex challenges and works on innovative and often AI focused projects while controlling and directing other engineering teams, external partners and stakeholders. The role is essential in providing our audience a great experience every time they open the VIX app and will be key to developing industry-leading reliability, quality, and performance.\n\n   In this role, as part of the R&D team, you will work closely with stakeholders in understanding what the business needs and translate that into technical requirements for research and development. Your core role will be to research, prototype and develop software. You will work on all aspects of software development including front-end, back-end, database management, and other integrations.\n\n   ABOUT YOU:\n\n   You dive headfirst into challenges and have a problem-solving mentality. You are comfortable with failing often and fast on the road towards a solution. You evangelize software craftsmanship and operational excellence yet pragmatic to know when to incur technical debt versus 'doing it right'. This is a fine balance in an R&D team. You are confident yet humble enough to change your mind when new information presents itself. You value open communication and are willing to give and receive feedback.
