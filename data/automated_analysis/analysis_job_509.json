            "rationale": "The job description emphasizes building and automating processes for R&D in life sciences, focusing on data engineering, software development for lab automation, and integrating ML/AI. While generative AI is mentioned, the core tasks revolve around data models, experimental protocols, automation of lab equipment, and analysis of biological data, aligning more closely with the data-driven and predictive modeling aspects of an ML Engineer, particularly in a specialized domain like life sciences. The mention of 'generative AI' appears to be in the context of exploring genetic diversity rather than building core generative AI applications. The emphasis on 'data models to support experimental protocols', 'automates the generation of robot instructions', 'analysis and visualization of biological sequence- and screening-data', and integrating with 'ML Ops' strongly points to an ML Engineer role focused on productionizing scientific workflows."
