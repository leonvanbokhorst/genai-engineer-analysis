There are no tasks mentioned from Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization). While the applications are described as 'AI applications', the role's responsibilities are purely DevOps-focused (infrastructure, deployment, CI/CD, monitoring). The role does not involve integrating AI/ML features into the product itself, which aligns with the 'Software Engineer' profile, despite the context of AI applications."

The confidence score is 4 because while the tasks are unambiguously DevOps (Macro-Category A), classifying the profile requires interpreting how 'AI applications' context affects the distinction between 'Software Engineer' and 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' when the role is purely operational."
