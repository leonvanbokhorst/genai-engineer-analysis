            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on traditional data engineering tasks, specifically within the Azure cloud ecosystem. While it mentions collaboration with machine learning teams and leveraging generative AI, these appear to be supporting roles rather than the core focus of the position. The primary responsibilities revolve around data integration, ETL, and pipeline development, which do not align with the core responsibilities of an ML Engineer or a GenAI Engineer as defined in the coding book. The role is primarily about data infrastructure and support for AI/ML initiatives, not the direct development or deployment of AI models or generative AI applications."
