            "rationale": "The job description focuses on using AI models to write better code and evaluating AI-generated code, which aligns with the use of AI tools to enhance productivity rather than the core development or engineering of AI models themselves. There is no mention of core AI development tasks like algorithm design, model training, fine-tuning, or MLOps, which are central to ML Engineer and GenAI Engineer roles. The role is described as 'Big Data Engineer for AI Training' but the tasks involve 'crafting and answering questions' and 'evaluating and ranking code', which are more akin to data annotation or quality assurance for AI training data rather than engineering. The description explicitly states 'no requirement for previous AI experience', further distancing it from specialized AI engineering roles."
