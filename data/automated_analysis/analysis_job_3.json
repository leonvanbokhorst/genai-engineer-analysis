The successful candidate will be proficient in using machine learning techniques to build data processing pipelines, preparing ready-to-train datasets for large models.\n\n   If you are excited about the intersection of AI, Machine Learning, and Large Data, this role provides a unique opportunity to make a high-impact contribution.   \n\n   Our aim is to make video content creation available for all - not only to studio production!\n\n        You will be someone who loves to code and build working systems. You are used to working in a fast-paced start-up environment. You will have experience with the software development life cycle, from ideation through implementation, to testing and release.\n\n       You will join a group of more than 40 Engineers in the R&D department and will have the opportunity to collaborate with multiple research teams across diverse areas, our R&D research is guided by our co-founders - Prof. Lourdes Agapito and Prof. Matthias Niessner.\n\n   If you know and love Voicebox, Whisper, VALL-E, SPEAR-TTS and more - and you love machine learning and large data, then we would love to talk to you. We will also want to talk to you - if that's what you dream of doing.  \n\nWhat will you be doing?\n\n     In this position, you'll join the team to help develop our LLM-based TTS system that will provide our customers with voice clones that are indistinguishable from real voices. You will also help us create high quality, production ready code and take ownership of production pipelines. This would include:\n     * Designing, developing, and maintaining data processing pipelines, utilising machine learning techniques to handle vast amounts of text and audio data, while ensuring data quality and accessibility.\n     * Leveraging your understanding of machine learning algorithms and workflows to prepare data most effectively for usage in large scale models.\n     * Use Big Data tools and frameworks to process, analyse, and derive insights from structured and unstructured data.\n     * Collaborating with other ML Engineers and Researchers to understand their data requirements and provide them with ready-to-train datasets.\n     * Monitoring the performance of data pipeline and machine learning models, troubleshoot data-related issues, and perform root cause analysis to implement strategic solutions.\n     * Stay up-to-date with emerging technologies and tools in machine learning and data engineering to continually improve our data infrastructure.\n     * Document data pipeline architecture and workflow, present findings to relevant stakeholders, and provide training as needed., You will work in a hybrid setting with an office in Amsterdam",

While LLMs are mentioned in the context of TTS systems, the core focus is on the data engineering and ML aspects of preparing data for these models, rather than developing or fine-tuning the generative models themselves. The mention of 'Machine Learning Data Engineer' in the title and the responsibilities align strongly with the 'ML Engineer' profile, particularly the 'Data Engineering' and 'Modeling' tasks, with a focus on productionizing data for models."
