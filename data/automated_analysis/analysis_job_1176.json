            "rationale": "The job description focuses on applying existing legal tech and AI tools to improve legal processes rather than developing new AI models or core AI systems. While it mentions AI and data science, the emphasis is on 'deploying the right tools', 'managing and further developing these tools', and 'investigating opportunities of new technological developments' within the legal domain. This aligns more with using AI for productivity enhancement and process improvement, rather than core AI engineering or ML development, fitting the 'Ambiguous' profile as per the coding book's definition for roles primarily focused on the use of AI tools to enhance productivity."
