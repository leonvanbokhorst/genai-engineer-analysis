            "profile": "Ambiguous",
            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on traditional software engineering, data engineering (ETL, big data processing), and MLOps principles within a banking context. While it mentions 'big data' and 'calculation engines', there is no specific mention of machine learning models, generative AI, or predictive modeling techniques. The core responsibilities revolve around building and maintaining data pipelines, software applications, and deployment infrastructure, aligning more with a senior software engineer or data engineer role with MLOps responsibilities rather than an ML or GenAI Engineer. The mention of Java, Oracle, Linux, Kafka, and Azure DevOps further reinforces this. Therefore, it does not fit the criteria for ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer and is classified as Ambiguous as it's a technical role but not specifically AI/ML focused as per the coding book's definitions for ML/GenAI Engineer."
