Do you want to work at the forefront of the changes in the financial services industry and develop disruptive Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions? Then we have a challenging position for you!\n\n   You'll work directly with entrepreneurs and business counterparts to bring AI solutions from idea to production. We are looking for creative and passionate people with a \"go get it\" mentality. Our AI Engineers are multi-skilled and have strong machine learning, system design and coding skills combined with an understanding of the business context within which AI solutions are embedded.\n\nYour job\n\n   You'll work on a portfolio of use cases that range from improving customer contact (e.g. voicebot) to revolutionizing the way how we interact with documents by leveraging GenAI. As an AI Engineer, your main goal is to develop AI systems and solutions for our initiatives and for our client units. We take care of the full development cycle from exploring and identifying opportunities, experimenting, and creating prototypes, to developing scalable products. Effectively this means that per specific use-case our focus can be on a variety of Engineering solutions ranging from Backend to Frontend to API's to LLM to Machine Learning Models.\n\n   Your activities include:\n     * Participate in the ideation and design of AI solutions with intrapreneurs and business experts\n     * Support initiatives at S&I (new value propositions, innovations) with data-driven insights\n     * Experiment and implement new AI technologies (like chatGPT), algorithms and methods in one of our bank wide projects (e.g. in Financial Crime or Operations)\n\nWorking environment\n\n   You'll be working in the Artificial Intelligence team at Strategy and Innovation (S&I) in Amsterdam and we provide ample opportunities for hybrid working. We have a start-up vibe. Your team consists of people (20+) with a passion for AI and we work every day to create (measurable) impact for the bank. There is an open team atmosphere where initiative is encouraged, and we provide daily coaching for juniors in our teams.\n\n   Our goal is twofold: (1) to fuel innovation by developing and delivering AI solutions for the initiatives at S&I, and (2) to drive the adoption of AI across the bank by working with Client Units on some of the hardest AI problems within ABN AMRO.",
