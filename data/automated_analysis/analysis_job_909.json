While there are elements related to AI and ML (TASK3), MLOps (TASK5), and Software Development (TASK4), the role is described as a 'Fullstack Software Engineer' and the responsibilities are spread across multiple domains. The core focus appears to be on building features for the Dataiku DSS platform, which involves a broad range of software engineering tasks rather than a specialized focus on predictive modeling (ML Engineer) or generative AI applications (GenAI Engineer). The role also mentions using AI features, but not necessarily building core generative AI models or applications from scratch. Therefore, it is too broad and not a clear fit for the specialized profiles of ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer."
