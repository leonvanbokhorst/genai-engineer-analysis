While it mentions GenAI, the core responsibilities and technologies listed (API integrations, Braze, Google Cloud functions, JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, Liquid, App Scripts) are more aligned with traditional full-stack development and marketing automation rather than the core ML/GenAI engineering tasks of model building, fine-tuning, or deep generative model research. The role appears to be primarily focused on the application and integration of AI tools within a CRM context, rather than the development or deep customization of the AI models themselves, fitting the 'use of AI tools to enhance productivity' aspect of the Ambiguous profile."
