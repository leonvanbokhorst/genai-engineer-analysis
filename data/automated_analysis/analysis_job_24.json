It also involves core software engineering tasks like 'Develop and maintain data pipelines' (1.A.1) and data engineering tasks like 'Clean, pre-process, transform raw data' (1.B.3). The collaboration aspect (1.C.1) further supports a balanced role. While not explicitly stating traditional ML, the presence of GenAI tasks and data pipeline/transformation work points towards a 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile, as it requires both AI specialization and software engineering capabilities."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to both data engineering/pipelines and specific GenAI tasks (LLM, prompt engineering). The collaboration aspect is also evident. However, it lacks explicit mention of specific programming languages or MLOps tools, which would have elevated the confidence to a 5. The profile assignment is strongly supported by the explicit mention of LLM and prompt engineering alongside data integration tasks."
