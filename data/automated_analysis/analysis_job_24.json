            "profile": "Ambiguous",
            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on data analysis, data engineering, and the application of LLMs for marketing tasks, but it lacks the depth in model development, productionization, and core software engineering typically associated with an ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer. The emphasis is on using AI tools for marketing insights and optimization rather than building foundational AI systems. The role is more about leveraging AI for business intelligence and marketing effectiveness, which aligns with the 'Ambiguous' category's definition of primarily focusing on the use of AI tools to enhance productivity."
