            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on data analysis, data engineering, and the application of LLMs for marketing tasks, but lacks the core software development and MLOps components typically associated with a GenAI Engineer. While prompt engineering and LLM usage are mentioned, the primary emphasis is on data integration, transformation, and analysis for marketing insights, aligning more with a data analyst role that leverages AI tools rather than a role focused on building and deploying generative AI systems. The role does not fit the core responsibilities or evidence profile of an ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer."
