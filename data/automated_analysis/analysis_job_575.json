While these are related to the operational aspects of software and AI systems, they do not align with the core responsibilities of developing, fine-tuning, or deploying generative AI models or predictive ML models. The description lacks any mention of AI/ML specific tasks, modeling, or generative technologies, making it fall under the 'Ambiguous' category as it's a technical role but not directly related to AI/ML development as defined in the Coding Book."
