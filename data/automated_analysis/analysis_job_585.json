            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on security services and frameworks, with a mention of ML/GenAI as a factor in the evolving threat landscape. However, the core responsibilities and required skills are centered around traditional software engineering for security, threat analysis, and mitigation, rather than the development, fine-tuning, or deployment of generative AI models or predictive ML models. The role appears to be a security-focused software engineering position that *uses* or *defends against* AI, rather than a role that *builds* AI systems. Therefore, it does not fit the core definitions of ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer."
