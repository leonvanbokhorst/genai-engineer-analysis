While AI and Generative AI are mentioned as industry trends and part of the product landscape, the core responsibilities are centered around the 'Software Development & Integration' (Macro-Category A) aspects of the sales process and customer enablement. There are no explicit tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG implementation (Macro-Category B). The role is about selling and supporting software that *uses* AI, rather than building or specializing in AI models themselves. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."
