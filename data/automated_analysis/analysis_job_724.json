            "rationale": "The job description focuses on sales enablement, customer demonstrations, and technical guidance within a sales context, rather than core AI/ML development, engineering, or research. While it involves technical aspects related to a data science platform (Dataiku), it does not align with the core responsibilities or evidence profiles of an ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer. The role is primarily customer-facing and sales-support oriented, fitting the definition of 'Ambiguous' as it's not a technical AI development role and primarily focuses on the use of AI tools (Dataiku) to demonstrate value."
