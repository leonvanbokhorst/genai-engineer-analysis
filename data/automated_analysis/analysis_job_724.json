While it mentions 'Data Science / Generative AI / Machine Learning' as a background, the core responsibilities are about applying technical expertise to solve customer data challenges using the Databricks platform. There are no specific tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. The role is about selling and demonstrating a platform that *enables* data science and AI, rather than building AI models themselves. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile, where the primary focus is on software development and integration, with AI/ML as a domain of expertise to be leveraged in customer interactions."

The technical requirements are focused on platform demonstration, integration, and architecture, rather than core AI/ML model development. The mention of 'Data Science / Generative AI / Machine Learning' is in the context of a required background, not the primary day-to-day tasks. The role is clearly software engineering focused, with AI/ML as a domain of knowledge to support the sales process. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the phrasing 'Data Science / Generative AI / Machine Learning' could be interpreted slightly more broadly, though the surrounding context strongly points to the AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."
