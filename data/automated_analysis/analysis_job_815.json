            "rationale": "The job description emphasizes the development of AI-powered security platforms, leveraging ML/GenAI for threat defense and response. It highlights architecting, implementing, and scaling security solutions, with a focus on transforming threat defense from human-driven to AI-driven. While it mentions 'AI models and algorithms' and 'scalable, reliable, and high-performance software platform and services', the core focus leans towards applying these to security operations and incident response, which aligns more with predictive modeling and operationalizing ML for defense rather than building generative AI applications. The mention of 'extensive heterogeneous data' also points towards data-driven predictive tasks. The role involves mentoring and leading, but the primary technical focus is on building and scaling AI-driven security solutions, fitting the ML Engineer profile's emphasis on productionizing models and data-driven approaches for specific tasks like threat detection."
