However, the core responsibilities and technologies described are centered around traditional software engineering (Go, mobile apps, community tools, platform code) rather than the specialized development, fine-tuning, or deployment of generative models themselves. The role appears to be a senior software engineer position that *interacts* with AI systems, rather than a role focused on building or engineering the AI models or GenAI applications directly. Therefore, it does not fit the 'ML Engineer' or 'GenAI Engineer' profiles."
