            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on Go engineering and traditional software development tasks. While it mentions interacting with an 'AI-powered platform' and a 'Generative AI tool' (CF Spark), the core responsibilities and projects described are centered around building and launching software products (Mobile Apps, Community Tools, Chatbot) using Go. There is no indication of deep involvement in developing, fine-tuning, or deploying AI models themselves, which are the hallmarks of a GenAI Engineer or ML Engineer. The role appears to be primarily a backend/software engineering position that *integrates* with AI systems rather than *develops* them."
