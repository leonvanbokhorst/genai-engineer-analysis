        "rationale": "The job advertisement 'Field Service Engineer' provides no details about software development, AI/ML tasks, or related technologies. The title itself indicates a role focused on on-site technical support and maintenance, which falls outside the scope of the AI/ML and software engineering categories defined in the CODING_BOOK.md. Consequently, the role is classified as Not Relevant to the coding book's focus."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 1,
        "reasoning": "The job advertisement is extremely minimal, containing only a job title. There is no descriptive text to analyze against the CODING_BOOK.md. The classification of 'Not Relevant' is based solely on the common understanding of the job title, not on any specific content within the ad that aligns with or deviates from the coding book's categories. This makes the analysis highly speculative and lacking in concrete evidence from the ad itself."
