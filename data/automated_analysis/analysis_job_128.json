However, it lacks specific details about core AI/ML tasks like model development, fine-tuning, or generative AI techniques. The primary focus appears to be on software development and platform engineering, with AI/ML being a feature to be integrated rather than the core focus of the role. Therefore, it does not fit the 'ML Engineer' or 'GenAI Engineer' profiles and is classified as 'Ambiguous'."
