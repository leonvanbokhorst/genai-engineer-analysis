            "rationale": "The job description focuses on a 'Senior Full Stack Developer' role, primarily involving platform migration, maintenance, and development. While it mentions working closely with a machine learning team to add features, it does not specify any direct involvement in model development, training, or fine-tuning. The core responsibilities and technologies implied are more aligned with traditional software development and platform engineering rather than specialized AI/ML roles like ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer. The description lacks sufficient detail on AI-specific tasks or technologies to warrant a classification in those profiles."
