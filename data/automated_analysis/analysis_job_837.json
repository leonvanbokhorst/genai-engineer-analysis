While it mentions AI and generative AI, the core tasks described are platform engineering and implementation, suggesting the role is about building or managing the infrastructure that supports AI, rather than developing the AI models themselves. This aligns with the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile, which emphasizes Macro-Category A (Software Engineering) tasks with AI integration."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is concise but clearly indicates a focus on platform engineering and implementation related to AI on Azure. The mention of 'generatieve AI' provides context, but the primary task described is platform-centric. The confidence is high, but not perfect, as more detail on the specific AI tasks would solidify the classification further."
