Do you want to bridge the gap between machine learning and production systems? Then join our team as an ML Engineering intern!, We are looking for an intern to strengthen our team in one of two exciting graduation projects. You'll work on innovative AI solutions, focusing on automation, deployment, and optimization of machine learning systems. Your research and implementation will contribute directly to real-world applications, working closely with our AI engineers in a dynamic environment of start- and scaleups.\n\n   Your responsibilities:\n     * Design, develop, and optimize AI pipelines for scalable deployment.\n\n     * Research best practices for monitoring, versioning, and automating AI workflows.\n\n     * Implement solutions that enhance the efficiency and reliability of AI models in production.\n\n     * Collaborate with a small team to bring innovative AI solutions to life.\n\n   Your graduation project options:\n    1. Oddit: We are currently developing an LLM-based application called Oddit that is able to create AI roadmaps and strategies based on inputs such as interviews, data quality scans and code reviews. Basically, we automate our own workflow. Within this project there are plenty GenAI research angles, that will have direct impact on our product (Oddit).\n    2. Your AI Engineering Pitch: Bring your own AI engineering topic related to our focus industries ClimateTech, Marketplaces, or Mobility. Whether it's optimizing an AI model performance in Energy, improving real-time data pipelines in a geospatial setting, or enhancing the AI system scalability for a large platform, we encourage you to pitch an AI idea that aligns with our focus industry., We look for people that want to enjoy the ride of a start-up and benefit from the freedom in the role:\n     * A team of talented and ambitious ML engineers.\n     * Insights into real-world AI challenges and deployment strategies.\n     * The possibility of a full-time position as AI engineer at Enjins after your internship.",
