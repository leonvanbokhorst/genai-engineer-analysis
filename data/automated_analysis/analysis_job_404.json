While Generative AI is mentioned, the core responsibilities revolve around defining ML/AI architecture, strategic technical direction, and working closely with ML-Ops. The focus on 'ML Engineer' and 'platforms and capabilities' rather than solely building user-facing applications with GenAI, along with the mention of Search Ranking and Recommendations, aligns more closely with the broader scope of an ML Engineer who may incorporate GenAI as one of many tools, rather than a specialist GenAI Engineer."
