While it mentions collaboration with an 'AI team' and the infrastructure supporting 'deep learning exploration, development, and deployment', the core responsibilities described are for managing and optimizing the platform itself, not for developing or integrating AI/ML models directly into applications. There are no tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. Therefore, the role is classified as a Software Engineer with a specialization in cloud infrastructure and MLOps."
