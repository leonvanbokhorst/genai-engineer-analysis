While it involves supporting AI development, the core responsibilities and technologies are not directly related to building or fine-tuning AI models themselves, nor are they focused on the core tasks of an ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer. The role is primarily infrastructure-centric, making it fall under the 'Ambiguous' category as it's not a direct AI/ML development role."
