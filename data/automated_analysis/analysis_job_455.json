            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on pre-sales, customer relationship building, and advising on data architecture and design using the Databricks platform. While it mentions 'Data Science/ML' and 'Spark programming', it does not detail core responsibilities related to building, training, fine-tuning, or deploying ML/GenAI models. The emphasis is on demonstrating existing platform capabilities and integrating with the cloud ecosystem, rather than developing novel AI solutions. Therefore, it does not align with the core responsibilities of an ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer."
