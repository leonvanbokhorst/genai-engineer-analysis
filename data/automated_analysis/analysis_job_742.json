While it mentions exploring GenAI, LLM, and Copilots, these are presented as areas for exploration rather than core responsibilities. The primary tasks fall under Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering), with no explicit tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). Therefore, the role is classified as a 'Software Engineer' that is open to learning about AI technologies."

However, the mention of GenAI, LLM, and Copilots is aspirational rather than a defined task, making it slightly less definitive for an AI-focused role. The confidence is high because the core engineering tasks are well-defined."
