        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on tasks related to training and evaluating generative AI models, specifically through providing feedback and answering questions related to computer science for AI training. While it mentions 'software engineer' in the introduction, the core responsibilities described (1.B.1) are predominantly AI specialization tasks. There are no explicit mentions of core software engineering tasks like building applications, CI/CD, or MLOps. Therefore, the profile 'GenAI Specialist' is the most fitting."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the tasks related to AI model training and evaluation. However, it's a bit light on specific technologies and the 'software engineer' mention in the intro could be slightly confusing if not for the detailed task descriptions. The tasks are clearly in Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization), leading to a strong confidence in the 'GenAI Specialist' profile."
