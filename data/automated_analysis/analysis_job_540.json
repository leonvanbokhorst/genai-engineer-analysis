            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on software development, MLOps, and exploring new technologies, including generative AI. However, it lacks specific details about core AI/ML modeling tasks such as algorithm development, training, or fine-tuning generative models. The role seems to be more about building and maintaining platforms and pipelines for data science and AI, rather than directly developing AI models. The emphasis on 'full-stack developer' and 'engineering part' suggests a strong software engineering foundation applied to AI/data science contexts, but not a specialized AI/ML role. The mention of 'generative IA' and 'data science' is present but not detailed enough to classify it as a GenAI Engineer or ML Engineer."
