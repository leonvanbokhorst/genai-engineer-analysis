            "rationale": "The job description focuses on IT infrastructure, Linux systems, automation, and operations. While it mentions 'new technologies' and 'expanding systems and platforms', it lacks specific details about AI, machine learning, or generative models. The core responsibilities align more with traditional IT engineering and system administration rather than specialized AI roles like ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer. Therefore, it falls under the 'Ambiguous' category as it is not primarily an AI-focused technical role."
