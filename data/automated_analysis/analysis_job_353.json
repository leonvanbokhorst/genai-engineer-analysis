            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on the application of AI within a cloud-based customer service solution, emphasizing sales, business value, and customer interaction. While AI is mentioned, the core responsibilities revolve around technical sales strategy, product demonstration, and business requirements assessment, rather than the development, fine-tuning, or deep technical implementation of AI models themselves. The role appears to be more of a technical sales or solutions architect role that leverages AI concepts rather than a role that builds or engineers AI systems. Therefore, it does not fit the core definitions of ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer."
