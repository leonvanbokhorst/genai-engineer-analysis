            "rationale": "The job description focuses on using AI models to train other AI models by crafting questions and evaluating code. While it mentions 'generative AI models' and 'large language models', it does not involve the core responsibilities of developing, fine-tuning, or deploying these models, nor does it require deep technical skills in ML engineering such as algorithm development or MLOps. The role is primarily about human feedback for AI training, which aligns with the definition of 'Ambiguous' as a role that primarily focuses on the use of AI tools to enhance productivity or assist in AI development rather than being a core AI development role."
