        "rationale": "The job ad focuses exclusively on tasks related to training and evaluating AI models ('Het maken en beantwoorden van vragen met betrekking tot informatica om AI-modellen te helpen trainen.' and 'Het evalueren en rangschikken van code die door AI-modellen wordt gegenereerd.'). These tasks fall under Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization) and specifically under 'Model Development & Fine-Tuning'. There are no tasks mentioned from Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering). Therefore, the role is best classified as a specialist focused on the AI model aspect, fitting the 'ML Specialist (Data Scientist)' profile, assuming the 'AI models' are general ML models rather than specifically GenAI models given the lack of explicit GenAI terminology."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is clear about the core tasks (training and evaluating AI models) but lacks detail on the specific type of AI models (GenAI vs. traditional ML) and doesn't mention any software engineering tasks or specific technologies. This makes it lean towards a specialist role but the exact specialization is inferred."
