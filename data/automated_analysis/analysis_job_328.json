            "rationale": "The job description focuses on providing human feedback to train AI models by crafting questions and evaluating code generated by AI. While it mentions 'AI models' and 'generative AI models', it does not involve the core responsibilities of developing, fine-tuning, or deploying AI models from a technical engineering perspective. The role is more about human-in-the-loop training and evaluation, which aligns with using AI tools to enhance productivity rather than building AI systems. Therefore, it falls under the 'Ambiguous' profile as it's not a technical AI engineering role."
