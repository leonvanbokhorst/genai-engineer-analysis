            "rationale": "The job description focuses on 'Intelligent Automation' and 'robotic engineering' using tools like UiPath, which are primarily for Robotic Process Automation (RPA) rather than core AI/ML model development or generative AI applications. While AI and Machine Learning are mentioned as tools for fixing robots, the core tasks revolve around monitoring, maintaining, and deploying existing automation solutions, aligning more with business process automation than the specialized roles of ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer. The role also emphasizes business understanding and stakeholder collaboration, and lacks deep technical AI/ML or GenAI development responsibilities."
