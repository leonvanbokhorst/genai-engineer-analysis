        "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on traditional data engineering tasks such as designing, building, and optimizing data pipelines, and integrating these with existing systems. While it mentions collaboration with data scientists and analysts, there is no explicit mention of developing, fine-tuning, or deploying AI/ML models themselves, nor any specific Generative AI tasks like prompt engineering or RAG. The role is primarily about building and maintaining the data infrastructure that supports AI/ML initiatives, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile. However, given the absence of any AI/ML model development or integration tasks, and the strong emphasis on data pipelines and architecture, it leans more towards a traditional 'Software Engineer' role with a data focus, rather than an AI-focused one. The 'Tech Lead' aspect also points to core software engineering leadership."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to data pipeline engineering and technical leadership. However, it lacks specific details about AI/ML model development or integration, making it difficult to definitively place it within an AI-specific role. The absence of any mention of AI/ML technologies or tasks means it's classified as a Software Engineer, but a higher score would require explicit AI/ML responsibilities."
