While it mentions generative AI and learning, it lacks the depth in core AI/ML tasks such as algorithm development, model training, fine-tuning, or MLOps specific to AI models that would classify it as an ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer. The emphasis is on using AI as a component within a broader software development context, rather than specializing in the AI models themselves."
