While there's an element of AI model improvement (1.B.1), the primary emphasis is on applying and integrating these AI capabilities into a broader system (1.A.1) to deliver customer support. The role is not primarily about developing novel AI models from scratch or deep specialization in GenAI techniques but rather about using and enhancing AI within a support context. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' best fits this description, as it involves building or maintaining software that uses AI features as a core part of its functionality."
