While it mentions AI and LLMs in the context of future exploration and interfacing, the core responsibilities and required skills are centered around traditional software development, data pipeline architecture, and Java programming. There is no direct evidence of building, fine-tuning, or deploying generative models, nor is there a strong emphasis on MLOps or predictive modeling as a primary function. The role is primarily focused on software engineering and data infrastructure rather than AI/ML model development or deployment."
