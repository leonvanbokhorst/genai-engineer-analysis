            "rationale": "The job description emphasizes building and deploying generative AI applications, fine-tuning LLMs, and working with frameworks like LangChain (implied by RAG and agents). While it mentions ML models, the explicit focus on LLMs and generative AI, alongside software development and MLOps for user-facing systems, aligns best with the GenAI Engineer profile. The mention of 'Data Scientist / AI Engineer' in the title also suggests a blend, but the core responsibilities lean towards generative AI applications."
