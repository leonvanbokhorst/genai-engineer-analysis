The provided coding book is specifically designed for analyzing GenAI Engineer roles and its task categories (Macro-Categories A and B) are defined exclusively in the context of AI/ML tasks and technologies.

The definitions within the coding book are all tied to AI/ML tasks and technologies, making it impossible to map the security-specific responsibilities to the book's categories. This clear mismatch leads to a high confidence in assigning the 'Not Relevant' profile."
