            "rationale": "The job description focuses on using AI models to generate and evaluate code, rather than building, fine-tuning, or deploying AI models. The core tasks involve crafting questions and evaluating AI-generated code, which aligns more with using AI tools for productivity enhancement or data annotation rather than a core AI engineering role. There is no mention of core AI engineering tasks like model development, MLOps, or deep involvement in data pipelines for model training. The emphasis is on 'training AI models' through human feedback and 'engaging with these models as they learn to code', which suggests a role closer to data annotation or AI-assisted content creation rather than engineering the AI systems themselves."
