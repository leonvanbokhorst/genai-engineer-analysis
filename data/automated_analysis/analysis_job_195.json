While it mentions 'emerging technologies' and 'innovative ideas', it does not specify any Generative AI or core Machine Learning technologies, models, or frameworks. The core responsibilities revolve around Pega system implementation, configuration, integration, and maintenance, which falls outside the scope of ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer profiles as defined in the coding book. It is primarily a Pega-focused DevOps role."
