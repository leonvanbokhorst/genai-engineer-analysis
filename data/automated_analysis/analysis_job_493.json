        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on software development tasks (1.A.1) such as contributing to the development of GenAI services, implementing coding best practices, integrating services into a product ecosystem, and optimizing existing services. While it mentions GenAI services and staying informed on AI technologies, there are no specific tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). The emphasis is on building and integrating AI into a broader product, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about its focus on software engineering principles applied to GenAI services. However, it lacks specific details on the *type* of GenAI work (e.g., model building vs. integration) and doesn't mention any specific technologies or tools, which would have increased confidence further. The profile assignment is strongly supported by the task descriptions."
