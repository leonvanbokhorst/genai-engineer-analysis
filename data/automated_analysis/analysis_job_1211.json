            "rationale": "The job description focuses on pipeline engineering for rendering technology, creative tooling, and artistic collaboration. While it involves software development and deployment, it does not explicitly mention core AI/ML tasks like model training, generative AI techniques, or predictive modeling. The emphasis is on building and maintaining technical pipelines for creative workflows rather than developing AI-driven features or systems. Therefore, it falls outside the scope of ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer and is classified as Ambiguous."
