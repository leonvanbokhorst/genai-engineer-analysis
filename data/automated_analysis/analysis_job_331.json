            "profile": "Ambiguous",
            "rationale": "The job description focuses on using AI models to train them by providing human feedback, specifically by crafting questions and evaluating code generated by AI. While it mentions 'generative AI models' and 'large language models', it does not involve the development, fine-tuning, or deployment of these models from an engineering perspective. The core tasks described are more aligned with data annotation and evaluation rather than core AI engineering responsibilities like algorithm development, MLOps, or building AI-powered applications. Therefore, it falls under the 'Ambiguous' category as it primarily focuses on the use of AI tools to enhance productivity and is not a technical AI engineering role."
