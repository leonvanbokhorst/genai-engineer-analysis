While 'LLM providers' are mentioned in the tech stack, there are no specific tasks related to developing, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG for LLMs. The role is about building and scaling a software platform, not about developing or integrating AI/ML models as core features of the product. Therefore, it aligns with the 'Software Engineer' profile."

The mention of 'LLM providers' in the tech stack is too vague to indicate a role focused on AI/ML tasks."
