While it mentions 'LLM Integration & AI Services' and working 'at the intersection of AI and customer engagement,' these are presented as components within a broader software engineering role rather than the core focus. There is no mention of specific generative AI models, fine-tuning, RAG systems, or advanced prompt engineering, which are hallmarks of a GenAI Engineer. The role appears to be a general Software Engineer position that *uses* AI services, rather than developing or specializing in generative AI itself, aligning with the 'Ambiguous' profile for roles primarily focused on the use of AI tools for productivity."
