        "rationale": "The job ad primarily focuses on traditional software engineering tasks such as developing and deploying back-end solutions, modernizing product lines, and conducting code reviews. While it mentions leveraging AI tools to improve efficiency and integrating AI-driven solutions, the core responsibilities and the emphasis on 'AI-driven innovations' within product lines point towards a role that builds software that *uses* AI, rather than focusing on the development or specialization of AI models themselves. There is no mention of specific AI model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. Therefore, the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile is the most fitting."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering responsibilities and mentions the integration of AI. However, it lacks specific details about the AI technologies or models to be used, which would have allowed for a higher confidence score. The focus is more on the application of AI in software development rather than deep AI specialization."
