While it mentions 'generative AI journey' and 'AI-driven innovations', the core responsibilities focus on leveraging AI tools for coding, error detection, feature development, and bug fixing, and integrating AI-driven solutions into cloud services. This aligns more with using AI as a productivity enhancer rather than a specialist in building AI systems, fitting the definition of the 'Ambiguous' profile."
