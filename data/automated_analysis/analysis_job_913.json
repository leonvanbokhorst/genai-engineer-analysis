While Python is mentioned, the core responsibilities are centered around the AI/GenAI specialization (Macro-Category B) rather than traditional software engineering (Macro-Category A). There's no indication of building or integrating AI into broader software applications, nor are there core software engineering tasks like API development or microservices. Therefore, 'GenAI Specialist' is the most appropriate profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines tasks related to training AI models and data creation, and mentions RLHF. The primary focus is on the AI/GenAI specialization. However, the description of 'Software Engineer' in the title and the mention of 'Python' could be slightly misleading if interpreted as a traditional software engineering role. The tasks themselves are clearly AI-focused, leading to a high but not perfect confidence score."
