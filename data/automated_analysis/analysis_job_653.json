While it mentions experimenting with AI tools like GPT-4 Vision, the core responsibilities are rooted in software engineering tasks (1.A.1). There are no explicit tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). Therefore, the role is classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, where AI is a component integrated into software solutions rather than the primary focus of development."

While it mentions specific AI tools, the emphasis is on building and deploying systems, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile well. The confidence is high, but not perfect, as the depth of AI involvement beyond integration isn't fully detailed."
