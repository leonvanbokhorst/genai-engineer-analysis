While it mentions supporting Data Science and Management, it does not describe core ML/GenAI engineering tasks like model development, fine-tuning, or advanced prompt engineering. The technologies mentioned (Kafka, Kubernetes, Prometheus, Grafana, Go, Python) are more aligned with traditional infrastructure and data engineering roles rather than specialized ML or GenAI engineering. The role is primarily about building and maintaining the underlying systems that support data operations, not about building or deploying AI models themselves."
