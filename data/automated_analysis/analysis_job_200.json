It mentions 'AI-driven features' and 'innovative tools' but does not provide enough information to classify it as an ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer. The mention of 'C# Developer' and the low salary range also suggest a more traditional software development role, potentially using AI tools rather than building core AI systems, which aligns with the 'Ambiguous' profile."
