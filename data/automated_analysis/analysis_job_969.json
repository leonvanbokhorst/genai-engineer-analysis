While it mentions 'generative AI models' and 'large language models', it does not require the candidate to build, fine-tune, or deploy these models. Instead, it emphasizes the use of AI tools for training and evaluation, aligning with the definition of 'Ambiguous' where the role primarily focuses on the use of AI tools to enhance productivity or assist in tasks, rather than core AI development or engineering."
