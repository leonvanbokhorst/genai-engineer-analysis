We are curious generalists who don't pigeon-hole ourselves as particular \"flavors\" of engineer and never say \"that's not my job\".\n   * Collaborate with customers through full engagements; you'll learn about their business challenges, rapidly design and develop prototypes to solve them, showcase the functionality you've written in demos and finally see the difference you've made when customers deploy solutions into their production environments.\n   * Work with the latest AWS services and open-source technologies to build your prototypes. You'll always be encouraged to pick the right tools for the job.\n\n   About the team\n   We are a team of problem-solvers and builders who work on our customer's challenges that don't have cookie-cutter solutions. We work with the latest 5G and GenAI technologies and partner with leaders in these spaces. We often don't have the answers right away, and are expected to Dive Deep to figure out the best approach.
