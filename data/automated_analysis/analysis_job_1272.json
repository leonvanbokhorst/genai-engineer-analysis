While it mentions the 'adoption of ML/GenAI' and tasks related to analyzing threats and researching techniques (which touch upon Macro-Category B), the core responsibility is building and operating security services and frameworks. The role is about integrating ML/GenAI into security solutions rather than developing the ML/GenAI models themselves. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering responsibilities and mentions ML/GenAI in the context of security threats. The tasks are well-defined, but the specific application of ML/GenAI is within a security domain, making it slightly less direct than a pure GenAI role. The confidence is high due to the clarity of the software engineering tasks, but not a perfect 5 because the ML/GenAI aspect is more about application in a specific domain rather than core model development."
