            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on traditional DevOps practices, automation, CI/CD, and managing software systems in a Kubernetes environment. While it mentions 'Data & AI DevOps team' and 'IBM Knowledge Catalog product portfolio' which involves data and AI capabilities, it does not detail specific tasks related to building, fine-tuning, or deploying generative AI models, RAG systems, or advanced prompt engineering. The core responsibilities described align more with general software engineering and operations rather than specialized AI/ML engineering roles like ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer. Therefore, it falls under the 'Ambiguous' category as it's primarily a DevOps role with a focus on AI-related products but not the core AI development itself."
