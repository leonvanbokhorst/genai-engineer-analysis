        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on designing architectural frameworks and strategies for AI-driven systems that automate software development processes (1.A.1). While there is mention of R&D and staying updated on AI technologies (1.B.1), the core responsibility is integrating AI into software solutions and improving development outcomes, rather than developing AI models themselves. The role is strategic and innovation-driven (1.C.1, 3.5), but the primary output is enhanced software development, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the responsibilities, distinguishing between what the role entails and what it does not. It emphasizes the integration of AI into software development processes rather than core AI model building. The strategic and R&D aspects are present but secondary to the software engineering integration. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the specific AI technologies or models are not detailed, leaving some room for interpretation on the depth of AI specialization."
