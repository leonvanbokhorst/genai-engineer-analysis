            "rationale": "The job description emphasizes leading software delivery and integration of GenAI components, but lacks specific details on core GenAI tasks like model fine-tuning, RAG development, or advanced prompt engineering. While it mentions GenAI technology, the focus is on the 'delivery' and 'integration' aspects within a broader software engineering context, and it explicitly states that prior GenAI experience is not required, suggesting a more general software engineering leadership role that incorporates GenAI rather than a specialized GenAI engineering role. The emphasis on adaptability, problem-solving, and learning on the job, without deep technical requirements in GenAI, points towards a role that might use GenAI tools or features but doesn't require building them from scratch or deep expertise in generative models themselves."
