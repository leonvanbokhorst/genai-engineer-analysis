            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on client interaction, technical consultation, and demonstrating a platform's value rather than core AI/ML model development or deployment. While it mentions 'data science' and 'Spark programming', it lacks specific details about building, training, or deploying generative AI models, MLOps, or advanced ML engineering tasks. The role appears to be more of a pre-sales technical consultant or solutions architect, which falls outside the scope of the specialized AI/ML engineering profiles."
