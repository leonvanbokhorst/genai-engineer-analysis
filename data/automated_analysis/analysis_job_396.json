In this position you'll craft high-quality open source software, understand customers, define user experiences and shape the future of IDEs for cloud development.\n\n   You will help us define cloud-native IDE experiences that are as welcoming as they are powerful. We are defining new experiences that use generative AI to help developer be more productive in their IDEs, including CodeWhisperer. You will interact with Amazon developers all over the world to identify and resolve pain points, fill in gaps in tooling, and evolve the IDE experience. You will analyze telemetry to keep us focused on our customer's needs. You'll also work with teams across Amazon who want to provide in-IDE experiences for their services. And you'll have the opportunity to learn and grow as an engineer.\n\n   Key job responsibilities\n   - Define cloud-native IDE experiences that are as welcoming as they are powerful.\n   - Interact with Amazon developers all over the world to identify and resolve pain points, fill in gaps in tooling, and evolve the IDE experience.\n   - Analyze telemetry to keep us focused on our customer's needs.\n   - Work with teams across Amazon who want to provide in-IDE experiences for their services.\n\n   On-Call Responsibility: This position involves On-call responsibility.

            "rationale": "The job description focuses on developing IDE experiences and enhancing developer productivity using generative AI tools like CodeWhisperer. While it mentions generative AI, the core responsibilities revolve around software development, user experience, and integrating AI features into existing tools, rather than building, fine-tuning, or deploying core generative models themselves. The emphasis is on the application and integration of AI for productivity, which aligns more with using AI tools rather than being a specialist in developing generative AI models. Therefore, it falls under the 'Ambiguous' category as it's primarily a software development role that leverages AI, rather than a dedicated GenAI Engineer role focused on core model development or deployment."
