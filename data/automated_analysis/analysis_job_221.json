The negative statements about project focus (\"No context-switching between countless small projects or chasing trendy tech\", \"No maintaining legacy internal systems\") imply a focus on core software development, aligning with 1.A.1. Software Development & Integration. Without any specific AI/ML tasks described in the ad, the most fitting profile based solely on the provided text is Software Engineer. The company name \"LearnwithAI\" suggests a potential AI/ML context, but this cannot be confirmed from the ad's content."

The profile assignment is based on the job title and the implication of core software engineering tasks from the negative statements, with minimal evidence to support or refute AI/ML involvement."
