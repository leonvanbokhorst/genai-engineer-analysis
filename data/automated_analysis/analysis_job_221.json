            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on traditional software development using Java and building scalable cloud-native platforms. While it mentions leveraging AI tools, natural language processing, and machine learning to enhance development efficiency and create tools for plan creation, it does not indicate the core responsibilities of designing, developing, fine-tuning, or deploying generative models themselves. The primary focus remains on software engineering with AI as an enhancement rather than the core technology being developed or manipulated. Therefore, it does not fit the 'ML Engineer' or 'GenAI Engineer' profiles."
