It explicitly mentions software engineering tasks like deployment, scaling, and optimization of AI systems. The mention of LLM-based application development and GenAI research angles provides context, but the primary responsibilities lean towards the engineering side. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as 'internship' roles can sometimes be broader in scope than a full-time position, and the 'pitch your own topic' option could lead to more specialized work depending on the intern's proposal."
