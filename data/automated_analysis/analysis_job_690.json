We're looking for a dynamic problem-solver to own the Billing and Revenue Management (BRM) systems at the core of our business. This is not your typical support or engineering role-it's a chance to work with a cutting-edge tech stack, while leveraging AI and automation to deliver solutions faster and smarter than the industry standard.\n\n   Unlike traditional positions, this role is laser-focused on BRM systems, demanding a deep understanding of their complexities. You'll be diagnosing and resolving maintenance tickets with precision, executing seamless deployments across environments, and conducting rigorous testing to ensure flawless performance-all while adhering to robust protocols to maintain system reliability. This isn't a job for someone seeking routine tasks. It's for someone who thrives on solving intricate problems, enjoys collaborating with both technical teams and customers, and is eager to make a tangible impact on business outcomes.\n\n   As part of our team, you'll be at the forefront of transforming how businesses approach customer retention through high-quality technical support. If you're excited by the idea of shaping the future of BRM systems in an AI-first environment, we want to hear from you.\n\n   What you will be doing\n\n     * Resolution of Maintenance Tickets: Diagnosing and resolving customer-reported issues in BRM\n     * Deployments: Executing deployments for the BRM component across environments, ensuring stability and readiness for customer use\n     * Testing: Conducting unit and integration testing to verify that fixes and updates meet quality standards before deployment\n\n   What you will NOT be doing\n\n     * New feature development or product innovation beyond what is required for maintaining and resolving BRM issues\n     * General customer inquiries outside of BRM-specific incidents and queries\n     * Strategic planning or product management; the role is execution-focused on resolving BRM issues efficiently\n     * High-level systems architecture or redesign work; it involves applying fixes, updates, and maintenance within established BRM infrastructure, * Ensure increased customer satisfaction and customer retention rates as a direct result of a superior BRM support system",
