We're looking for a dynamic problem-solver to own the Billing and Revenue Management (BRM) systems at the core of our business. This is not your typical support or engineering role-it's a chance to work with a cutting-edge tech stack, while leveraging AI and automation to deliver solutions faster and smarter than the industry standard.\n\n   Unlike traditional positions, this role is laser-focused on BRM systems, demanding a deep understanding of their complexities. You'll be diagnosing and resolving maintenance tickets with precision, executing seamless deployments across environments, and conducting rigorous testing to ensure flawless performance-all while adhering to robust protocols to maintain system reliability. This isn't a job for someone seeking routine tasks. It's for someone who thrives on solving intricate problems, enjoys collaborating with both technical teams and customers, and is eager to make a tangible impact on business outcomes.\n\n   As part of our team, you'll be at the forefront of transforming how businesses approach customer retention through high-quality technical support. If you're excited by the idea of shaping the future of BRM systems in an AI-first environment, we want to hear from you.\n\n   What you will be doing\n\n     * Resolution of Maintenance Tickets: Diagnosing and resolving customer-reported issues in BRM\n     * Deployments: Executing deployments for the BRM component across environments, ensuring stability and readiness for customer use\n     * Testing: Conducting unit and integration testing to verify that fixes and updates meet quality standards before deployment\n\n   What you will NOT be doing\n\n     * New feature development or product innovation beyond what is required for maintaining and resolving BRM issues\n     * General customer inquiries outside of BRM-specific incidents and queries\n     * Strategic planning or product management; the role is execution-focused on resolving BRM issues efficiently\n     * High-level systems architecture or redesign work; it involves applying fixes, updates, and maintenance within established BRM infrastructure, * Ensure increased customer satisfaction and customer retention rates as a direct result of a superior BRM support system",

            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on traditional software engineering tasks related to maintaining and deploying existing Billing and Revenue Management (BRM) systems. While it mentions leveraging AI and automation to deliver solutions faster, it explicitly states 'New feature development or product innovation beyond what is required for maintaining and resolving BRM issues' and 'High-level systems architecture or redesign work' are NOT part of the role. There is no mention of developing, fine-tuning, or deploying generative models, nor is there a focus on predictive modeling. The primary responsibilities revolve around ticket resolution, deployments, and testing within an established system, which aligns more with traditional software engineering or support roles rather than specialized ML or GenAI engineering."
