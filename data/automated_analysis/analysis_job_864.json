We're seeking an expert in educational measurement to join our innovative team at 2 Hour Learning. In this transformative role, you'll leverage your expertise in psychometrics and content creation to enhance our entire learning ecosystem.\n\n   You'll harness the power of generative AI to design personalized, engaging assessments while also analyzing learning data, quality-controling educational materials, and collaborating with Learning Strategists. Your impact will extend beyond testing-you'll play a crucial role in optimizing our entire curriculum for student success.\n\n   Your experience will be vital in synthesizing complex educational frameworks into AI prompts, yielding not just effective assessments but also insights that elevate our overall learning materials. You'll craft AI-first rubrics, ensuring all content aligns with rigorous standards and ignites curiosity.\n\n   This position demands a holistic view of the learning process. You'll analyze data to identify knowledge gaps, then collaborate with subject matter experts to address these in our curriculum. Your understanding of learning science and mastery-based learning will be instrumental in refining our instructional approach.\n\n   At 2 Hour Learning, we foster continuous improvement through our \"second brain\" knowledge-sharing approach. If you're excited to blend creativity with cutting-edge technology, collaborate across disciplines, and make a lasting impact on educational outcomes, we want to hear from you. Apply now and help us shape the future of learning!\n\n   What you will be doing\n\n     * Creating and refining test content to meet rigorous educational standards, using a blend of psychometrics and generative AI tools\n     * Developing assessment rubrics with the help of AI that evaluate the depth, alignment, and educational impact of the test content and learning materials\n     * Quality controlling learning content to ensure it meets high standards of engagement, accuracy, and effectiveness\n     * Analyzing test results, student data, and learning analytics to identify knowledge gaps and areas for improvement in our curriculum\n     * Collaborating with subject-matter experts to optimize our overall educational offerings, including test content and instructional materials\n     * Applying principles of learning science and mastery-based learning to enhance our curriculum and assessment strategies\n     * Participating in our \"second brain\" knowledge-sharing practices to contribute to and learn from our collective expertise\n\n   What you will NOT be doing\n\n     * Creating test content or curriculum materials manually - you will be leveraging AI tools for all content creation tasks\n     * Developing code to automate systems - you will focus on learning measurement and content design using AI, while our engineers handle the technical implementation\n     * Working in isolation - this role requires active collaboration across multiple teams and disciplines, Applying your psychometric expertise to develop and refine test content with the help of AI, ensuring the assessments are personalized, rigorous, and aligned with educational standards, while contributing to the overall improvement of our learning ecosystem through cross-functional collaboration and data-driven insights.",
