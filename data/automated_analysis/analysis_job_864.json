The core tasks fall under 'Software Development & Integration' (Macro-Category A), such as developing and maintaining Pega applications and integrating AI into the platform. While there's mention of 'AI-driven case management solutions' and staying updated on AI technologies, there's no explicit mention of core GenAI model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG implementation. The role appears to be about building software that *uses* GenAI, rather than specializing in the GenAI models themselves. Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' is the most fitting profile."

However, the specific nature of the 'GenAI capabilities' being integrated is not deeply detailed, leaving some ambiguity about the depth of AI specialization required. The primary focus remains on the Pega development aspect."
