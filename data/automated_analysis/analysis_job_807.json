While it mentions exploring integrations with Dify for LLM capabilities, this is a minor aspect and not the core focus. The primary responsibilities and technologies listed do not align with the core definitions of ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer, which require deep expertise in model development, training, or advanced generative AI applications. The role is more aligned with traditional software engineering and business-focused e-commerce development, making it 'Ambiguous' according to the provided coding book."
