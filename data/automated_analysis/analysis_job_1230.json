            "profile": "Ambiguous",
            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on infrastructure automation, cloud engineering, and developer experience, which are core aspects of a Platform Engineer role. While it mentions collaboration and learning new technologies, it lacks specific details about AI/ML model development, training, fine-tuning, or generative AI applications. The responsibilities align more with traditional infrastructure and software development rather than specialized AI engineering roles like ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer. Therefore, it falls under the 'Ambiguous' category as it is not primarily an AI-focused technical role."
