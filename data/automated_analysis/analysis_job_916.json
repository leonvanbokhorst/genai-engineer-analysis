While it mentions an 'interest in GenAI' and having shipped features, the core responsibilities and required experience are firmly rooted in software engineering (Macro-Category A). There are no explicit tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). Therefore, the role is classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, as it involves building software that may incorporate AI, but the primary focus is on the software engineering aspects."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is very clear about the core responsibilities being backend software engineering. The mention of AI is secondary and framed as an 'interest' rather than a primary requirement. The required skills and technologies are predominantly software engineering focused. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, because the extent of AI integration is not deeply detailed, leaving a slight ambiguity about how 'AI tech' is used in their platform beyond the 'interest' in GenAI."
