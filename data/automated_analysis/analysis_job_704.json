However, it lacks specific details about AI model development, training, or generative AI techniques. The core responsibilities and technologies mentioned (Salesforce, CPQ, CI/CD) are not directly related to the core definitions of ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer. Therefore, it falls under the 'Ambiguous' category as it's primarily a business-focused technical role not directly centered on AI/ML engineering."
