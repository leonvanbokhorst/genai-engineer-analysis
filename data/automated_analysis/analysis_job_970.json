            "profile": "Ambiguous",
            "rationale": "The job description focuses on using AI models to generate and evaluate code, which is more about interacting with and providing feedback on AI outputs rather than developing, fine-tuning, or deploying AI models. The core tasks described, such as crafting questions and evaluating code, do not align with the core responsibilities of an ML Engineer or a GenAI Engineer as defined in the Coding Book. The role seems to be more about human-in-the-loop feedback for AI training rather than core AI engineering. There is a mention of 'Big Data Engineer for AI Training' in the title, but the responsibilities described do not reflect typical Big Data Engineering tasks like data pipeline construction or infrastructure management. Therefore, it falls under the 'Ambiguous' category due to a lack of clear alignment with the defined technical AI engineering profiles."
