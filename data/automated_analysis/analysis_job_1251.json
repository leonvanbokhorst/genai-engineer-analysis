While AI is mentioned, the core responsibilities focus on building and integrating applications rather than deep AI model development or specialization. The use of Python and Javascript is incidental for data transformation and custom functions, not for core AI model building. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

The role is described as building applications with AI, rather than developing AI models themselves. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the depth of AI involvement is not extensively detailed beyond 'AI applications'."
