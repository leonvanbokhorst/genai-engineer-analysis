        "rationale": "The job advertisement focuses heavily on traditional software engineering tasks such as architecting solutions, leading transformations, advising on strategies across various technology domains (web, mobile, API, cloud, data), and selecting tools and frameworks. While 'genAI' is mentioned as an increasingly important area, the core responsibilities and the emphasis on leadership, business development, and broad software engineering expertise place this role firmly in Macro-Category A. The role is about advising clients on their digital journey, which includes integrating GenAI, rather than specializing in the development or fine-tuning of GenAI models themselves. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 5,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is very clear about the nature of the role, emphasizing leadership, client advisory, and broad software engineering expertise. The mention of GenAI is present but framed as an evolving area within a larger software engineering context. The responsibilities are well-defined and align clearly with the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."
