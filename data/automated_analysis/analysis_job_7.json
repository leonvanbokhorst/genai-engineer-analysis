You are used to working in a fast-paced start-up environment. You will have experience with the software development life cycle, from ideation through implementation, to testing and release. You will also have extensive knowledge and experience in Computer Vision and Generative AI domain.\n\n       You will join a group of more than 40 Engineers in the R&D department and will have the opportunity to collaborate with multiple research teams across diverse areas, our R&D research is guided by our co-founders - Prof. Lourdes Agapito and Prof. Matthias Niessner.\n\n   If you know and love DALL.E, MUSE, IMAGEN, MAKE-A-VIDEO, STABLE DIFFUSION and more - and you love large data and large compute, then we would love to talk to you.\n\nWhat will you be doing?\n\n     In this position, you'll join the team to help develop our foundational model for video generation based on large video data-sets. You will also help build the academic contributions in this area. In this role you will be conducting cutting edge research, pushing the boundaries and going beyond existing SOTA solutions. This would include:\n     * Reviewing specialised literature on text to video / video synthesis.\n     * Designing the requirements, project scoping and owning the roadmap in your area.\n     * Managing the progress of the Large Video Model project and making sure that it is in line with our vision.\n     * Building libraries to accelerate our iteration speed during development (abstracting common functionality, automating tests sweeps, visualising results etc.).\n     * Developing production quality software, our teams work \"full stack\" with the ability to deliver direct to product and impact the world.\n     * Taking ownership of the full ML lifecycle from concept, development, testing, validation to deployment.\n     * Adapting off-the-shelf solutions for the purposes of our product.\n     * Optimising for deployment - turning prototypes into working solutions., You will work in a hybrid setting with an office in Amsterdam",
