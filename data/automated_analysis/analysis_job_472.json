You accomplish this by considering a myriad of factors: the content strategy, channel specifications, the customer journey, best practices, data, tone of voice, and an outside-in approach. Sounds like a lot of variables, but you are adept at performance-based, audience-first content creation. You've honed this skill over years of experience.\n\n   For the past few months, you've been mastering the art of prompt engineering. Not only are you well-versed with the current generative AI tools and features, but you also stay abreast of new innovations. You often ponder: How can we implement novelties in our workflows? For what kind of projects can we suggest AI solutions to our clients? How much time can we save using a specific tool? You are one of the first to pitch ideas.\n\n   We are a young company where the brightest minds work every day on a wide range of clients, such as Beiersdorf, Canva, and smart. We prefer to have the most talented experts on board, but we are also looking for the perfect DEPT®-fit. Someone who is not afraid to learn, inspire, and strive for a better world. Someone who looks ahead, dares to take the stage, and toasts to a successful week with us on Friday afternoon.\n\n   For this role, we're looking for someone who speaks and writes Dutch on a native level.",
