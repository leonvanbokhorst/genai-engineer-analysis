        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on core software engineering tasks such as designing and building backend systems, cloud-native services, REST APIs, and optimizing CI/CD pipelines. While it mentions integrating AI models into customer workflows and working with ML engineers, the primary responsibilities and described tasks fall under Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering). There are no explicit tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, where software engineering is the primary focus, with AI integration as a key feature of the product."

The language used directly maps to core software engineering tasks, with AI integration being a feature of the product rather than the core focus of model development. This clarity allows for a high-confidence classification."
