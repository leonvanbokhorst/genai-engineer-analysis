While it mentions experimenting with specific AI tools like GPT-4 Vision and Amazon CodeWhisperer, the core responsibilities are centered around software engineering tasks (Macro-Category A). There are no explicit tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). Therefore, the role is classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, as it involves building software that utilizes AI features."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering tasks related to AI integration. However, it lacks detail on the specific AI methodologies or models beyond mentioning a couple of tools, making it slightly less definitive than a role explicitly detailing model training or advanced GenAI techniques. The profile assignment is strongly supported by the emphasis on building and integrating rather than core AI model work."
