While it mentions 'cutting edge technologies in the security field', it lacks any specific mention of AI, machine learning, generative models, or related concepts, which are central to the ML Engineer and GenAI Engineer profiles. Therefore, it does not fit the criteria for a technical AI role and is classified as Ambiguous."
