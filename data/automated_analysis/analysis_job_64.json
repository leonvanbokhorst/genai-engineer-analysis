While it mentions 'cutting edge technologies in the security field' and 'protect IBM's customers from cyber threats at scale', it lacks any specific mention of AI, machine learning, generative models, or related technologies. The role appears to be a standard Software Developer position, not one focused on AI/ML engineering."
