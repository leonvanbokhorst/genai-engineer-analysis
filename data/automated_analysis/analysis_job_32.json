        "assigned_profile": "AI-Adjacent Software Engineer",
        "rationale": "The job ad focuses on developing a data science platform (Macro-Category A) and supporting data scientists in AI use cases (Macro-Category B). The primary emphasis appears to be on building and enabling the infrastructure for AI, rather than the core development or specialization in AI models themselves. The mention of 'AzureML' suggests a cloud-based data science environment, and the role involves bringing 'Engineering and Data Science together', indicating an integration role. Given the balance and the nature of the tasks, it leans towards a software engineering role that is adjacent to AI development."
    },
    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is relatively clear about the core responsibilities, distinguishing between building a platform and supporting AI use cases. However, it lacks specific details on the depth of AI involvement or the exact nature of the 'data science platform', which prevents a perfect score. The mention of 'AI use cases' is broad and could encompass traditional ML or GenAI, but the overall framing suggests a platform/engineering focus."
