While it mentions AI use cases, the primary responsibilities lean towards data infrastructure and supporting existing AI development rather than building AI systems themselves. The role is described as 'Senior Cloud Data Engineer', further reinforcing the data engineering focus. Therefore, it does not fit the specific requirements of a GenAI Engineer or ML Engineer."
