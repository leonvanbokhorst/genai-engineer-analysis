            "profile": "Ambiguous",
            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on data engineering tasks and supporting data scientists, with a mention of AzureML. However, it lacks specific details about developing or deploying generative AI models, fine-tuning LLMs, or building RAG systems, which are core to the GenAI Engineer profile. While it involves AI use cases, the primary emphasis is on the data infrastructure and support for data science experiments, making it lean towards a data engineering role rather than a specialized GenAI Engineer. It doesn't fit the core responsibilities of an ML Engineer either, as it doesn't emphasize algorithm development or predictive modeling as the primary focus. Therefore, 'Ambiguous' is the most appropriate classification due to the lack of specific GenAI or ML engineering focus."
