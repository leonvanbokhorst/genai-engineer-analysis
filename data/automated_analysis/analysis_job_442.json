Phrases like 'AI as their co-pilot', 'elevating your coding skills', 'crafting AI tools that clarify complex concepts', and 'AI as a booster, not a replacement' indicate a focus on AI-assisted development rather than core AI engineering roles like ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer. There is a lack of specific technical details regarding AI model development, training, or deployment, which are central to the ML Engineer and GenAI Engineer profiles."
