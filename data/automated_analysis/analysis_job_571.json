While 'Generative AI' is mentioned as a vision for empowering users with a personalized data analyst, the core responsibilities described are focused on building and maintaining the data infrastructure and models that would support such a vision, rather than directly developing or fine-tuning GenAI models themselves. The role is about enabling others through data and platform enhancement, with AI being an integrated aspect of the product vision rather than the primary focus of the engineer's tasks."

The mention of 'Generative AI' is in the context of a future vision rather than direct implementation tasks for the role. This makes the classification as 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' quite strong, but not a perfect 5 due to the slight ambiguity on how deeply the 'Generative AI' aspect will be involved in the day-to-day tasks."
