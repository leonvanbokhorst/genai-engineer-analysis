While it involves AI, it does not emphasize the core responsibilities of developing, building, or deploying AI models or applications from scratch, nor does it require deep expertise in ML engineering or GenAI development. The role is primarily about using and refining existing AI tools for customer support, which aligns with the 'use of AI tools to enhance productivity' aspect of the Ambiguous profile."
