        "rationale": "The job description heavily emphasizes traditional software engineering tasks, covering the full development lifecycle and various engineering disciplines. While 'generative AI' is mentioned as an area of development, it's listed alongside many other software engineering specializations, and no specific GenAI tasks are detailed. The title 'Senior Polyglot Software Engineer' further supports a primary software engineering focus. This aligns with the AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile, where the role is primarily software engineering but involves integrating or developing features related to AI/ML."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite detailed regarding the software engineering aspects and the overall culture. However, the mention of 'generative AI' is quite high-level and not elaborated upon with specific tasks. This leaves a slight ambiguity as to the depth of AI involvement, but the strong emphasis on traditional software engineering makes the AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile highly probable."
