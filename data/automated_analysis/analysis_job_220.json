            "profile": "Ambiguous",
            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on software development and architectural design within an EdTech context, leveraging AI concepts. However, it lacks specific details about core AI/ML tasks such as model training, fine-tuning, data engineering, or MLOps. The emphasis is on building applications *around* AI-powered features rather than developing the AI models themselves. The role is described as 'Senior Full-Stack Engineer' and the responsibilities lean towards traditional software engineering with an AI flavor, rather than a specialized AI/ML role. It doesn't fit the core definitions of ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer, and it's not a technical AI role in the sense of building or deeply understanding the underlying AI models. Therefore, 'Ambiguous' is the most appropriate classification as it primarily focuses on the use of AI tools to enhance productivity and product features, rather than the development or deep specialization in AI/ML itself."
