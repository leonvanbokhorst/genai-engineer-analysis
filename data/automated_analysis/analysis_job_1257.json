While it mentions the use of Generative AI (ChatGPT, Prompt Engineering, NLP) for specific tasks like test design and identifying findings, the primary role remains within the 'Software Development & Integration' macro-category (1.A.1). The AI tasks are integrated into the existing quality engineering process rather than being the core focus of model development or specialization. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile, where AI/ML features are integrated into a product or process, but the core role is not AI development itself."

The distinction between core AI development and AI-assisted processes is evident. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the depth of AI involvement is described in terms of application within testing rather than core AI model building."
