While it involves interacting with AI and fine-tuning, the core responsibilities are centered around customer support and ticket resolution, which aligns more with using AI tools for productivity enhancement rather than core AI engineering. The role does not demonstrate a strong emphasis on core AI development tasks like algorithm design, model training from scratch, or building complex AI-driven applications."
