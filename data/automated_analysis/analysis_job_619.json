It also highlights building RAG systems (implied by Q&A applications), fine-tuning (implied by developing generative models), and integrating these models into production-grade user-facing software systems, which are core responsibilities of a GenAI Engineer. While ML Engineer tasks are present, the focus on generative models and their application in user-facing systems points more strongly to the GenAI Engineer profile."
