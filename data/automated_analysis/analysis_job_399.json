            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on data engineering, data science, and consultancy, with a mention of NLP, time series modeling, and image recognition. However, it lacks specific details about generative AI models, LLMs, RAG, fine-tuning, or specific generative AI frameworks. The core responsibilities described align more with traditional data engineering and data science roles rather than a specialized GenAI Engineer. The mention of 'Data scientist' in the role title and description, alongside 'Data engineer/developer', further indicates a broader scope than a dedicated GenAI Engineer."
