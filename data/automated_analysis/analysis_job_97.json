            "rationale": "The job description emphasizes building a 'Syntho Engine Core Application' using 'Generative AI models', 'Python', and 'FastAPI'. It also mentions developing and implementing 'cutting-edge machine learning algorithms and models', improving and extending 'key functionalities of our software solution', and identifying 'new features'. The responsibilities align with developing and deploying AI-powered applications, particularly with the mention of Generative AI, which is a core focus of the GenAI Engineer profile. While 'Machine Learning' is in the title, the specific mention of 'Generative AI models' and the application-building context points more strongly to a GenAI Engineer role than a general ML Engineer focused solely on predictive modeling."
