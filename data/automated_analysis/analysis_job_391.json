While it mentions leveraging AI and LLMs, the core tasks revolve around software development, data pipelines, and turning research into robust analytics with minimal maintenance. The role is about building and integrating AI capabilities into a broader analytics platform rather than focusing solely on model development or GenAI specialization. The emphasis is on the software engineering aspects of delivering an AI-powered tool, making it an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer role."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the development of an analytics platform and mentions AI/LLMs as tools within that context. The tasks lean towards software development and data pipeline professionalization. The profile assignment is strong, but a slightly lower score is given because the specific AI/ML tasks are not as deeply detailed as in a pure ML Engineer role, and the primary focus is on the platform's functionality rather than the AI models themselves."
