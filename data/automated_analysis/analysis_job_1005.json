        "rationale": "The job ad focuses exclusively on tasks related to training and evaluating AI models, specifically generative AI models that write code. The core responsibilities involve crafting questions for AI training and evaluating AI-generated code. While it mentions 'generative artificial intelligence models', the tasks described (crafting questions, evaluating code) are more aligned with the data labeling and evaluation aspects that support model development rather than the engineering of the models themselves or their integration into applications. There are no tasks related to software development, integration, operations, or MLOps. Therefore, the role is best classified as a specialist role focused on the data and evaluation side of AI model development, fitting the 'ML Specialist (Data Scientist)' profile, albeit with a focus on generative AI outputs."

The profile assignment is strongly supported by the described tasks, but the lack of technical details prevents a perfect score."
