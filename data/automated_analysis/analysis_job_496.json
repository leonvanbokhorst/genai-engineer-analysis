This includes popular brands such as Pixel, Nest, Fitbit, and Chromecast.\n\n   Our product security team is composed of defensive and offensive security engineers that prevent, detect, and mitigate vulnerabilities across a variety of product lines and services. We collaborate with product development teams on system design, hardening, code analysis, security testing, and other security assurance functions with the goal of minimizing the risk of abuse and increasing the cost of vulnerability exploitation. In addition to our work with other Google groups, we are connected to the security community through our vulnerability rewards programs and conferences.\n\n   As an Offensive Security Engineer, you will join our offensive security program for Made-by-Google devices that are powered by Android, GenAI features, and other technologies. The program's scope is broad and covers system software, SoC, wireless communications, Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), and other subsystems. You will focus on device wireless connectivity security and will contribute to individual as well as collaborative projects, including security research and red-team exercises, with the goal of discovering and proving product deficiencies at the implementation and design levels. You'll also evaluate the security of fundamental building blocks in hardware, firmware, and software (first-party and third-party) that power existing and new connected devices like phones, tablets, devices, cameras, content streamers, and other smart home products.\n     * Define and drive offensive security projects on connected devices including their wireless components, features, and associated subsystems.\n     * Conduct security research in areas of high security risk and contribute to the planning and execution of red-team engagements.\n     * Find and experimentally demonstrate the exploitability of attack vectors and vulnerabilities on the device wireless communication stack.\n     * Propose solutions to security issues and contribute to the design of mechanisms to mitigate or eliminate the risks.\n     * Identify and drive projects to automate the team's offensive security work.",
