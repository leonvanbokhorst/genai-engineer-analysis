        "rationale": "The job ad clearly states the team builds 'AI-powered tools that suggest intelligent code to developers' and expands 'generative AI capabilities to build APIs integrating large language models (LLMs)'. It explicitly mentions 'prompt engineering' and lists projects like 'AI-powered Code Suggestion feature', 'scan repositories for context to make suggestions better', and 'explain code and write tests' using AI. While there's a strong emphasis on traditional software engineering tasks (1.A.1), the core purpose of the role and the specific projects are centered around Generative AI (1.B.2). The balance of strong software engineering fundamentals with specific GenAI tasks, particularly LLM integration and prompt engineering, points to the 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job advertisement is very clear about the team's focus on generative AI, LLMs, and prompt engineering, while also detailing the expected software engineering practices. The examples of projects further solidify the GenAI focus. The language used is direct and unambiguous, allowing for a high degree of confidence in the analysis and profile assignment."
