While AI is mentioned as a tool to enhance these processes and is integrated into the product lines, the core responsibilities and the majority of the coded phrases fall under Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering). There are no explicit tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, where AI is a component of the software being built rather than the primary focus of model creation or specialization."
