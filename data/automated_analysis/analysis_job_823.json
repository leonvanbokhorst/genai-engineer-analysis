            "profile": "Ambiguous",
            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on cloud platform engineering, infrastructure, DevOps, and traditional software development practices. While it mentions 'GenAI, LLM and Copilots' as technologies to explore, the core responsibilities and tasks are not centered around developing or fine-tuning generative AI models, but rather on building and managing the infrastructure that might support them. The role is primarily about cloud architecture, CI/CD, and DevOps, which aligns more with infrastructure engineering than a specialized GenAI or ML Engineer role. Therefore, it falls under the 'Ambiguous' category as it's a technical role but not directly focused on AI model development or application building using GenAI."
