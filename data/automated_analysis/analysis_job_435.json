            "profile": "Ambiguous",
            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on the use of AI as a tool to enhance existing software development processes and productivity, rather than on the core development, fine-tuning, or deployment of AI models themselves. Phrases like 'AI as their co-pilot', 'elevating your coding skills', 'crafting AI tools that clarify complex concepts', and 'emphasizing its role as a booster, not a replacement' suggest a role that leverages AI for efficiency rather than building AI systems. There is a lack of specific technical details regarding AI model development, training, or deployment, which are characteristic of ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer roles. The emphasis is on 'software development' enhanced by AI, not on AI engineering itself."
