You and the team will be responsible to define, architect, and develop the core of our production and automation pipeline - the actual heart of Grip's capability to create and deliver product images at unprecedented scale and quality.\n\n   You will be spearheading our Graphics development projects, mentoring colleagues, and providing first-hand technical and automated solutions for our artists and the ecosystem behind Grip. Together with our Development and Operations teams, you will also ensure the pipeline is well set up and working at maximum efficiency.\n\n   Automation is in your heart, and you aren't afraid to get your hands dirty with developing some code. Creating an automated and state-of-the-art pipeline for breathtaking visual results with the pipeline team is your number one goal. You'll also deeply understand and give guidance around the inner aspects of Computer Graphics, Rendering, Modelling, Compositing, Workflows, and further aspects of 3D content production at scale. It is your passion to combine your knowledge in these areas with automation driven by code, inside and outside of 3D applications.\n\nWhat will you be doing?\n\n     * In close collaboration with our CTO and different technical and artistic teams, define, develop, and run the next version of our rendering technology (both from a creative tooling & pipeline perspective and our end-user software).\n     * Guiding and making pipeline technology choices and defining the future architecture of our technology platform.\n     * Close collaboration with our Grip development and technical teams to identify shared (technical) approaches.\n     * Collaborating with our artists to develop the tools and automation they need.\n     * Build, test, & deploy frequent changes and updates to the pipeline.\n     * Document and possibly train artists to use the pipeline, pick up enhancements, and implement directly.",
