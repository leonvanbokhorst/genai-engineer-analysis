It also includes traditional ML tasks like evaluating classification algorithms (1.B.1) and software integration tasks like migrating to MS Copilot (1.A.1). The emphasis on LLMs, conversational AI, and prompt evaluation, combined with data pipeline work, points towards a role that balances AI specialization with engineering practices, fitting the 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to data pipelines, LLM prompt evaluation, and migration to new AI platforms. While it mentions traditional ML tasks, the focus on conversational AI and LLMs is evident. The role seems to blend data engineering with GenAI specialization. The confidence is high, but not perfect, as the exact balance between traditional ML and GenAI could be slightly clearer, and the 'Data Engineer' title might suggest a stronger emphasis on data pipelines than on model development itself, though the tasks listed lean towards GenAI."
