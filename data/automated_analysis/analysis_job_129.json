        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on software development and platform maintenance ('drive the migration/handover', 'maintaining and further developing', 'add new machine learning driven features'). While it mentions working with a machine learning team and adding ML-driven features, the core responsibilities are centered around the platform itself, rather than the development or specialization of the ML models. There are no specific GenAI or traditional ML tasks mentioned, only the integration of ML-driven features. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering responsibilities related to platform development and integration of ML features. However, it lacks specific details about the nature of the ML features or the technologies involved, which prevents a perfect score. The role is clearly software-focused with an AI component."
