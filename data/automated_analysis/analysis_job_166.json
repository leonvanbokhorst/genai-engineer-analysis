        "rationale": "The job advertisement describes a Data Engineer role focused on developing data products within a Data Mesh architecture to enable software engineers. While it mentions data and enabling software engineers, it does not contain any tasks or technologies related to AI/ML model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, RAG, or the specific tools associated with AI/ML. Therefore, it does not fit any of the AI/ML-focused profiles and is classified as 'Not Relevant' in the context of GenAI Engineer roles."

There are no mentions of AI or ML technologies, making the classification straightforward. The role is clearly defined as a traditional data engineering position, not related to AI/ML."
