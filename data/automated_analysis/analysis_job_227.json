While it involves GenAI (1.B.1) and data pipelines (1.B.3), the emphasis is on building and integrating these components into broader solutions, rather than deep model development or specialized GenAI tasks. The primary output is software that interacts with AI, making it AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

The profile assignment is relatively straightforward based on the balance of these tasks. A slightly lower score is given because it's an internship role, which might imply less autonomy or depth compared to a full-time position, but the described tasks are clear."
