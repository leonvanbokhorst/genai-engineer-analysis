            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on traditional C++ software development, including design, development, testing, and maintenance of existing software (NX CAM). While 'AI' is mentioned in the title, the responsibilities and technologies listed do not indicate a focus on building, fine-tuning, or deploying generative AI models, nor do they involve core ML engineering tasks like predictive modeling or MLOps. The role appears to be a traditional software engineering position that may *use* AI tools or integrate with AI systems, rather than developing or engineering AI itself, aligning with the 'Ambiguous' profile for non-AI technical roles or roles primarily focused on the use of AI tools."
