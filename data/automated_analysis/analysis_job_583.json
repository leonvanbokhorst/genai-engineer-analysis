            "rationale": "The job description focuses on developing an AI-powered security platform but does not specify the use of generative AI models (LLMs, diffusion models) or advanced techniques like RAG or PEFT. While it mentions 'ML/GenAI', the core responsibilities lean towards traditional software engineering for security solutions, with AI being a component rather than the primary focus of model development or fine-tuning. The role emphasizes building scalable platforms and services, leveraging existing AI models, and collaborating with security experts, which aligns more with applying AI within a security context rather than developing core AI models or GenAI applications. Therefore, it falls under the 'Ambiguous' category as it's not clearly a GenAI Engineer or ML Engineer role focused on core AI model development."
