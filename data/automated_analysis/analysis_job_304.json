Phrases like 'help train AI models', 'train generative artificial intelligence models', 'engaging with these models as they learn to code', 'Crafting and answering questions related to computer science in order to help train AI models', and 'Evaluating and ranking code generated by AI models' all fall under Macro-Category B: GenAI Specialization, specifically 1.B.1 Model Development & Fine-Tuning. There are no tasks mentioned that fall under Macro-Category A: Core Software Engineering. Therefore, the role is predominantly focused on the AI specialization aspect, leading to the 'ML Specialist (Data Scientist)' profile, with the understanding that the 'ML' here is being used in a broader sense to encompass AI model training and evaluation, and the 'GenAI' aspect is specified by the mention of generative AI models."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines tasks related to training and evaluating AI models. However, it lacks specific technical tool mentions and doesn't detail the software engineering aspects that would be present in a more integrated role. The profile assignment is strong based on the described tasks, but the absence of technical details slightly reduces the confidence from a perfect score."
