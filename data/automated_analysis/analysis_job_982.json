There are no mentions of core software engineering tasks like building applications, MLOps, or integrating AI into existing systems (Macro-Category A). All identified tasks fall under GenAI Specialization (Macro-Category B), specifically Model Development & Fine-Tuning. Therefore, the 'GenAI Specialist' profile is the most appropriate."
