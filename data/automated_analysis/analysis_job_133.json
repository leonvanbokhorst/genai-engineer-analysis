While it mentions supporting 'full stack' teams, the core responsibilities revolve around the ML lifecycle, including troubleshooting, CI/CD integration, defining automated processes for services and data pipelines, implementing tooling for orchestration, experiment tracking, deployment, and Infrastructure as Code. The focus on building and improving infrastructure for ML workflows, experiment tracking, and repository templates aligns directly with the 'ML Engineer' profile, particularly its emphasis on MLOps and productionizing models."
