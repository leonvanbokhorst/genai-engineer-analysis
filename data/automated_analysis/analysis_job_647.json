        "Functieomschrijving": "Is translating educational theories into actionable assessments your superpower? Do you thrive in environments where excellence is the norm, dissecting and designing with a level of precision that only the keenest eye can achieve?\n\n   We're scouting for an expert in psychometrics with a flair for distilling complex educational measurements into clear, effective tests to sculpt revolutionary educational experiences. Think you have checked all the right boxes so far? Then this is your opportunity to shine.\n\n   At 2 Hour Learning, we're not just tinkering with the idea of AI in education; we're orchestrating a full-blown transformation. Scrap the old playbook of manual test creation. Textbooks? Obsolete. In this role, you will wield the power of generative AI to design prompts that delve deep into the subject matter, commanding it to produce test content that's personalized, engaging, and rigorous.\n\n   Your experience in quantitative measurement and educational content creation will help you synthesize complex frameworks into AI prompts, yielding razor-sharp test questions that align tightly with educational standards. You will then quality control your outputs by crafting AI-first rubrics, ensuring each question and answer hits the mark and stimulates curiosity, enriching the learning journey. It's all about a relentless pursuit of excellence, a continuous cycle of refinement, and a dedication to content that not only meets but exceeds the bar.\n\n   This role goes beyond just creating assessments. You'll be a key player in a collaborative environment, working across teams to improve our entire educational ecosystem. If you identify knowledge gaps during testing, you'll dive into our learning content and student data, partnering with subject matter experts to enhance our overall educational offerings.\n\n   At 2 Hour Learning, we practice knowledge sharing through our \"second brain\" approach, fostering an environment of continuous learning and collaboration. If you're seeking a role where you can blend creativity with technology, collaborate across disciplines, and where your contributions have a lasting impact, 2 Hour Learning is where you belong. Take the leap and apply now!\n\n   What you will be doing\n\n     * Creating and refining test content to meet rigorous educational standards, using a blend of psychometrics and generative AI tools\n     * Developing assessment rubrics with the help of AI that evaluate the depth, alignment, and educational impact of the test content\n     * Enhancing the quality of test content through a streamlined, iterative process for consistently superior and challenging assessments\n     * Analyzing test results and student data to identify knowledge gaps and areas for improvement in our learning content\n     * Collaborating with subject matter experts to address identified gaps and enhance our educational offerings\n     * Participating in our \"second brain\" knowledge-sharing practices to contribute to and learn from our collective expertise\n\n   What you will NOT be doing\n\n     * Creating test content manually - you will be using generative AI tools (such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude etc.) for every task\n     * Developing code to automate systems - you will focus on test design using AI, while our engineers handle the tech specifics\n     * Working in isolation - this role requires active collaboration across multiple teams and disciplines, Applying your psychometric expertise to develop and refine test content with the help of AI, ensuring the assessments are personalized, rigorous, and aligned with educational standards, while contributing to the overall improvement of our learning ecosystem through cross-functional collaboration and data-driven insights.",
