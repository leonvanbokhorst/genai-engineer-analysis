            "rationale": "The job description heavily emphasizes the development and deployment of applications built on top of large language models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. While it mentions 'Machine Learning Engineer' in the title, the core responsibilities like 'Craft, implement, and fine-tune machine learning algorithms, focusing on Retrieval-Augmented Generation and LLM,' 'Partner closely with medical specialists to translate their expertise into our AI engine,' and the mention of 'vectorial representations' strongly align with the definition and core responsibilities of a GenAI Engineer, particularly in building user-facing AI systems and integrating generative models. The emphasis on MLOps and production deployment further supports this classification."
