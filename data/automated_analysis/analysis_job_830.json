        "assigned_profile": "Core GenAI Engineer",
        "rationale": "The job ad requires significant experience in traditional software development (TypeScript, Python) which falls under Macro-Category A. It also explicitly requires familiarity with GenAI implementation, including LLMs and vector databases, which are core GenAI specialization tasks (Macro-Category B). The balance between these two areas, with a clear focus on GenAI technologies, leads to the 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile."
    },
    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly states requirements for both software development (TypeScript, Python) and specific GenAI technologies (LLMs, vector databases, toolcalling). The passion for GenAI and following developments also points towards the specialized nature of the role. While it doesn't detail specific software engineering tasks beyond language proficiency, the GenAI requirements are quite explicit. A score of 4 reflects high confidence due to the clarity of the GenAI focus and the mention of core programming languages."
