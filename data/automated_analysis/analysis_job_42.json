While it mentions interacting with an 'AI-powered platform' and developing an 'AI Chatbot' and 'Generative AI tool', these appear to be features integrated into the broader software product rather than the core focus of the role. The majority of the responsibilities and the primary technology (Go) are rooted in software engineering, with AI/GenAI being a component that the software interacts with or supports. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly states the primary technology (Go) and core software engineering responsibilities. The mention of AI/GenAI is present but not the dominant theme, allowing for a clear classification. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the depth of involvement with the AI platform and chatbot is not fully detailed, leaving a slight ambiguity on whether it leans more towards integration or deeper AI work."
