However, it does not detail core responsibilities or required skills related to developing, fine-tuning, or deploying generative models themselves. The primary focus is on building and scaling software that *uses* or *interacts with* AI, rather than the AI development itself, fitting the criteria for 'Ambiguous' as it's not a core AI engineering role."
