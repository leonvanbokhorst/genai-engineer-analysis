While it mentions AI technologies like GPT-4, RAG, and AI-driven innovations, these are presented as features to be integrated into existing products or to enhance the software development process itself, rather than core AI model development or deep AI research. The role is about building software that *uses* AI, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile. There's a strong focus on software engineering practices like code reviews, scalability, and cloud-native development."
