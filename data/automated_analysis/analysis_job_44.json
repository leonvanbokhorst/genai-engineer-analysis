            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on providing technical solutions and consulting for issues related to Databricks, Spark, and related data/AI technologies. While it mentions AI and ML, the core responsibilities revolve around troubleshooting, code-level analysis, and guiding customers on existing platforms and features rather than designing, building, or fine-tuning novel AI models or generative AI applications. The emphasis is on supporting customer use cases and resolving reported issues within a specific platform, which aligns more with a technical solutions or support role than a dedicated ML or GenAI Engineering role. The mention of 'Generative AI Fundamentals' and 'Scaling AI' in the preamble seems to be marketing content rather than core job requirements."
