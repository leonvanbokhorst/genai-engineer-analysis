It involves deep code-level analysis of Spark internals, performance tuning, and assisting customers with data science and data integration challenges within the Spark ecosystem. While Generative AI is mentioned, the core focus is on the broader Spark/ML/AI platform, data engineering, and productionizing solutions, aligning more closely with the responsibilities of an ML Engineer who deals with data-driven predictive models and MLOps within a platform context, rather than a GenAI Engineer focused on LLMs and generative applications."
