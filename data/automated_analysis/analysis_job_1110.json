        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on traditional software engineering tasks such as system configuration, maintenance, incident management, and implementing/managing AI-driven systems. While AI is mentioned as a tool to enhance these processes, the core responsibilities do not involve developing or fine-tuning AI models themselves (Macro-Category B). The role is about integrating and managing AI within existing operational frameworks, aligning with Macro-Category A. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the tasks and responsibilities, emphasizing software engineering and operational aspects enhanced by AI tools. It explicitly states it's not a traditional engineering or support role but combines technical work with AI tools. The lack of specific AI model development tasks (like training or fine-tuning) makes the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile a strong fit. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the description of 'AI System Building' could be interpreted slightly differently, though the context leans towards integration and management."
