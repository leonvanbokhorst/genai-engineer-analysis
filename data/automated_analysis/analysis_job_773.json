            "profile": "Ambiguous",
            "rationale": "The job title is 'DevOps Engineer' and while it mentions 'Generative AI (GenAI)' and 'GenAI solutions', the core responsibilities and tasks described focus heavily on DevOps practices, collaboration, and solution delivery rather than the deep technical development, fine-tuning, or advanced prompt engineering typically associated with a GenAI Engineer. The role seems to be about embedding existing GenAI capabilities into solutions and managing their deployment, rather than building the GenAI models themselves. It also lacks specific technical depth in AI modeling or data engineering required for ML/GenAI Engineer roles. Therefore, it leans towards a role that uses AI tools rather than develops them, fitting the 'Ambiguous' profile."
