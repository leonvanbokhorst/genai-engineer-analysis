            "rationale": "The job description heavily emphasizes fine-tuning LLMs, building AI-powered products and modules, and leveraging advanced AI for internal processes and customer-facing enhancements. This aligns directly with the core responsibilities and typical projects of a GenAI Engineer, particularly in areas like Modeling (TASK3) using generative techniques and Software Development (TASK4) for user-facing applications. The mention of 'birth groundbreaking AI-powered products' and 'AI-driven efficiency' further supports this classification over an ML Engineer, which typically focuses more on predictive modeling and data-driven algorithms for tasks like classification or regression."
