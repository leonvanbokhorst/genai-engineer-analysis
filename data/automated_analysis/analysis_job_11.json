In this position you'll craft high-quality open source software, understand customers, define user experiences and shape the future of IDEs for cloud development.\n\n   You will help us define cloud-native IDE experiences that are as welcoming as they are powerful. We are defining new experiences that use generative AI to help developer be more productive in their IDEs, including CodeWhisperer. You will interact with Amazon developers all over the world to identify and resolve pain points, fill in gaps in tooling, and evolve the IDE experience. You will analyze telemetry to keep us focused on our customer's needs. You'll also work with teams across Amazon who want to provide in-IDE experiences for their services.
