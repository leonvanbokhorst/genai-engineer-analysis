In this position you'll craft high-quality open source software, understand customers, define user experiences and shape the future of IDEs for cloud development.\n\n   You will help us define cloud-native IDE experiences that are as welcoming as they are powerful. We are defining new experiences that use generative AI to help developer be more productive in their IDEs, including CodeWhisperer. You will interact with Amazon developers all over the world to identify and resolve pain points, fill in gaps in tooling, and evolve the IDE experience. You will analyze telemetry to keep us focused on our customer's needs. You'll also work with teams across Amazon who want to provide in-IDE experiences for their services. And you'll have the opportunity to learn and grow as an engineer.\n\n   Key job responsibilities\n   - Define cloud-native IDE experiences that are as welcoming as they are powerful.\n   - Interact with Amazon developers all over the world to identify and resolve pain points, fill in gaps in tooling, and evolve the IDE experience.\n   - Analyze telemetry to keep us focused on our customer's needs.\n   - Work with teams across Amazon who want to provide in-IDE experiences for their services.\n\n   On-Call Responsibility: This position involves On-call responsibility.

Since the Covid19 pandemic we adjusted to remote work and established a hybrid work environment in which engineers spend 3 days working in the office, adjusted to the team needs.\n\n   Mentorship & Career Growth\n   We're committed to the growth and development of every member of the team, and that includes our development managers. As a senior software development engineer you will play a vital part in growing your peers. You will have the opportunity to contribute to the culture and direction and deliver site-wide initiatives that will improve the life of all of our teams. AWS is a growth environment - we are hiring and scaling rapidly to meet the needs of our customers. You'll have the opportunity to grow your scope of influence naturally as we scale and will have get to hire & develop other leaders along the way.\n\n   About the team\n   When we started building the IDE EDEX team, we set out to create a place where engineers can deliver great work. That means finding and hiring people who value great engineering but who also value professional and personal relationships. We are a global business, so your ability to work with people with diverse viewpoints and backgrounds will be important. As software engineers, we need to balance a lot of things. To us, \"agile\" means balancing software craftsmanship, operational excellence, and delivering value to our customers - while also allowing the team to plan work and life in a predictable way, work hard without needless distractions or fire drills, and spend quality time away from work.\n\n   We take risks, but we hold each other accountable for results and how the results were achieved. We have a long-term vision, but we don't do big designs up front. Our goals are clear and we are working on things that are important to everyone on the team… and to Amazon.",

            "rationale": "The job description focuses on enhancing developer productivity within IDEs using generative AI tools like CodeWhisperer, rather than on the core development, fine-tuning, or deployment of generative AI models themselves. While it mentions generative AI, the primary emphasis is on software development for IDEs and improving user experience, with AI serving as a feature or tool rather than the core technology being engineered. This aligns more with using AI to enhance productivity within a software development context, fitting the 'Ambiguous' profile's criteria for roles primarily focused on the use of AI tools to enhance productivity."
