            "profile": "Ambiguous",
            "rationale": "The job description focuses on traditional full-stack software development, feature implementation, and maintaining enterprise-level services. While it mentions 'DeepL Business Technology space' and 'enablement services', there is no explicit mention of AI, machine learning, generative models, or related technologies. The responsibilities described align more with general software engineering rather than specialized AI roles like ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer. The emphasis on collaboration, communication, and remote work are soft skills and company culture aspects, not core technical AI responsibilities. Therefore, it falls under the 'Ambiguous' category as it is not a technical AI role."
