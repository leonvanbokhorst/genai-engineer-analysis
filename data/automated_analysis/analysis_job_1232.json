Reavant's AI Agents can help real estate professionals create, parse, interpret, and interrogate documents such as contracts as well as act autonomously to perform otherwise manually time-consuming tasks.\n\n   You'll tackle a mix of research (20%), design (20%), and engineering (60%) challenges to drive our product and service to the next level. Working closely with our hands-on CTO, you will create or adapt functionality with the right balance of quality, performance, speed, and usability.\n\n   As our first technical hire, you will have a significant and visible impact on our product, service, and company., Activities where you will make a difference include:\n     * Design and run experiments & evaluations on various Machine Learning tasks (Generative AI, classic NLP or other).\n     * Design and build a user workflow, interaction, or widget.\n     * Design and engineer an offline or online MLOps workflow.\n     * Productize i.e., translate an experimental subprocess from a notebook to the SaaS code base.\n     * (Re)architect the solution at all levels and morph it into a better version of itself.\n     * Adhere to modern coding standards, write unit tests where necessary.\n     * Follow the newest technologies and smartly pick the most promising and relevant ones.\n\n   At this stage, shipping imperfect functionality and learning from its usage by customers is more important than producing perfection.
