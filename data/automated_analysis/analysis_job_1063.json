These fall under Macro-Category A. While there are no explicit AI/ML development tasks (Macro-Category B), the job title 'Speech Analytics' implies that the application being maintained and developed is AI-powered. Therefore, the role involves building and maintaining software that supports AI/ML models, fitting the definition of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines backend development and operational responsibilities. The AI aspect is implied by the job title and a mention of learning about AI, but the core tasks described are not AI-specific. This makes the classification as 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' highly probable, but not absolutely definitive without more detail on the 'Speech Analytics' application's AI components."
