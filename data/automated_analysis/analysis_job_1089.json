While AI is mentioned as a focus area ('AI applications', 'AI compliance'), the core responsibilities do not involve developing, fine-tuning, or engineering generative AI models or traditional ML models. Instead, the role focuses on the operational and integration aspects of AI within a software engineering context, fitting the definition of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."
