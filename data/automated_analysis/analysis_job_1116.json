While AI is mentioned as a tool and a core component of the systems being managed, the focus is on the operationalization and integration of these systems rather than the core development or fine-tuning of AI models themselves. The tasks are predominantly from Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration), with AI being a feature of the systems being worked on, rather than the primary focus of model building or research. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the responsibilities, distinguishing itself from traditional engineering roles and highlighting the use of AI tools for operational tasks. The tasks described are consistently aligned with software engineering and system support, with AI as an enabler. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the specific AI technologies or models are not detailed, and the term 'AI System Building' could be interpreted with slightly more depth, though the context strongly suggests integration and management."
