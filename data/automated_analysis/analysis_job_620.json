        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on traditional software engineering tasks such as developing web and mobile applications, integrating services into existing applications, and building middleware layers with API definitions and authentication. While it mentions LLMs and their deployment on an Nvidia stack using virtualization, these seem to be features being integrated into a broader software product rather than the primary focus of model development or deep AI research. The role is primarily about building and integrating software that *uses* LLMs, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software development and integration tasks. The mention of LLMs and deployment is present but not deeply detailed, making it lean towards an adjacent role rather than a core AI/ML role. The confidence is high because the core software engineering aspects are well-defined, but not a perfect 5 due to the limited detail on the AI/ML specific aspects."
