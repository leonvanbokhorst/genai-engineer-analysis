Execute applied research plans to understand, apply, test, evolve, and generalize these technologies into reusable frameworks.\n     * Build reliable and robust ML and AI solutions to address business problems, accounting for constraints of the production environment.\n     * Develop production-grade machine learning code, from models to features and pipelines, allowing for scalability, realtime, monitoring and retraining.\n     * Build readable and reusable code, applying in depth knowledge of business area tools and product needs. Choose the right technology or coding methodology by researching and understanding customer needs as well as refactor and simplify code (when necessary).\n     * Monitor product health, performance and business impact and act accordingly when requirements are not met.\n     * Solve issues by applying methods and insights gained from a variety of disciplines. Complete different tasks and navigate into several environments with a short adapting period.\n     * Continuously evolve their craft. Keep up to date with industry and academic standard methodologies, periodically explore new technologies, introduce them to the machine learning community and promote their application in areas where they can generate impact.\n     * Actively contribute to Machine Learning at Booking.com through training, exploration of new technologies, interviewing,onboarding and mentoring colleagues.\n     * Push for improvements, scaling and extending machine learning tooling and infrastructure, collaborating with the other central teams.",
