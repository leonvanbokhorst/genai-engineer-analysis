        "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on integrating AI capabilities into customer support systems and improving existing AI models through feedback and fine-tuning. While there's an element of AI model improvement (1.B.1), the primary emphasis is on the application and integration of AI within a broader system (1.A.1), rather than deep model development or specialization. The role is about supporting and enhancing an AI-augmented system, making 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' the most fitting profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines tasks related to AI integration and improvement within a support context. The distinction between core AI development and applying AI in a support function is reasonably clear. However, the ad is brief and lacks specific technical details, which prevents a perfect score."
