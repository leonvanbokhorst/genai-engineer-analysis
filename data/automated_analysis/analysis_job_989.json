            "rationale": "The job description focuses on providing human feedback to train AI models, specifically by crafting and evaluating code generated by AI. While it mentions 'generative AI models' and 'large language models', the core tasks described do not involve the development, fine-tuning, or deployment of these models from an engineering perspective. Instead, it emphasizes human interaction with the models for training purposes, which aligns more with data annotation or quality assurance for AI training rather than core AI engineering roles like ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer. The description lacks details on algorithm development, MLOps, or building production-grade software systems that are central to the other profiles."
