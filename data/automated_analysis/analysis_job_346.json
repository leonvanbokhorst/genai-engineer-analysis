You will work as part of a distributed agile team developing and testing the RWS software. The fast-paced agile development cycle will require you to use several testing approaches, design and write test automation code as well as executing manual testing. You will be a part of a product team that consists of highly skilled and experienced Java developers and QA engineers and work closely with them to deliver high-quality and innovative software.\n\n   Our teams build scalable Java microservices based on Spring, JPA 2.0, OpenSearch, GraphQL, OpenAPI RESTful web service and more to support our Tridion Content Management products. These microservices are provided to customers on-premise and supported in the cloud using Docker-based AWS container services. Our services run on popular RDBMS' and OpenSearch.\n\n   Our Content Management software runs at customers serving millions of page views per day served by hundreds of servers. Our customers include many big-name brands. So, you can imagine the technological challenges we face in order to provide a scalable architecture that not only does what customers want, but also performs well. We did a pretty good job so far: we are a leader in the Structured content management area. But to stay on top, we are looking to expand with talented QA Engineer to help define and drive technical initiatives to keep the platform current and more efficient., * Create test plans based on Risk-based testing technique\n     * Define the required QA coverage for the stories in the team Grooming and Planning meetings\n     * Execute automated and manual tests in accordance with the test plan\n     * Configure environments for testing purposes\n     * Co-ordinate with the developers, reproduce issues when required, and steer the defect through its lifecycle\n     * Define the scope of regression testing for every release using a Risk-based approach\n     * Design and create automated test cases in the Java automation suite\n     * Seek out and identify opportunities for test automation\n     * Design and monitor nightly runs of automated tests\n     * Design and execute performance tests\n     * Analyze performance test results and provide comprehensible results",
