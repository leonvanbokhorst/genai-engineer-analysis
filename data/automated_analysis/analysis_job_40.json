This title and technology suggest a role focused purely on frontend development using a specific framework, with no mention of AI/ML tasks or responsibilities. Therefore, it aligns with the 'Software Engineer' profile, which exclusively involves tasks from Macro-Category A and does not integrate AI/ML."

        "reasoning": "The job advertisement is exceptionally minimal, containing only a title and a primary technology. It lacks any descriptive details about responsibilities, tasks, or required skills beyond the very basic. This makes a thorough analysis impossible, and the classification is based on a very limited understanding of the actual role. The analysis is essentially a guess based on the title alone."
