It mentions working with LLM providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google, and developing interactive dashboards. The core responsibilities align with building and deploying generative AI solutions, which is the primary focus of a GenAI Engineer. While there's a mention of 'AI Engineer' and 'Machine Learning Engineer' as potential self-identifications, the specific tasks and technologies point more strongly towards generative AI applications rather than general predictive modeling."
