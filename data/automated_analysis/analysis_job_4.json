        "Functieomschrijving": "We are looking for an experienced Machine Learning Engineer, with passion for working on cutting edge problems that can help us create highly realistic, emotional and life-like synthetic humans through text-to-video.\n\n   Our aim is to make video content creation available for all - not only to studio production!\n\n        You will be someone who loves to code and build working systems. You are used to working in a fast-paced start-up environment. You will have experience with the software development life cycle, from ideation through implementation, to testing and release.\n\n       You will join a group of more than 40 Engineers in the R&D department and will have the opportunity to collaborate with multiple research teams across diverse areas, our R&D research is guided by our co-founders - Prof. Lourdes Agapito and Prof. Matthias Niessner.\n\n   If you know and love Voicebox, Whisper, VALL-E, SPEAR-TTS and more - and you love machine learning and large data, then we would love to talk to you. We will also want to talk to you - if that's what you dream of doing.  \n\nWhat will you be doing?\n\n     In this position, you'll join the team to help develop our LLM-based TTS system that will provide our customers with voice clones that are indistinguishable from real voices. You will also help us create high quality, production ready code and take ownership of production pipelines. This would include:\n     * Creating new or refining existing data processing pipelines that will run on very large amounts of data.\n     * Taking hypotheses, ideas or papers and creating implementations of solutions on the back of these.\n     * Running experiments on the back of the created implementations to evaluate and verify your hypotheses.\n     * Work on model training and inference optimisation.\n     * Contributing to a high-quality codebase, developing tests where necessary, and participating in code reviews.\n     * Helping a team of Research engineers and Scientists to write clean and efficient code, and define best practices.\n     * Taking ownership of the full ML lifecycle from concept, development, testing, validation to deployment.\n     * Developing production quality software, our teams work \"full stack\" with the ability to deliver direct to product and impact the world.\n     * Optimising for deployment - turning prototypes into working solutions., You will work in a hybrid setting with an office in London",
