While it mentions R&D in AI technologies (a Macro-Category B task), the primary emphasis is on leveraging AI to revolutionize software development itself, rather than developing core AI models or GenAI specific applications. The role is about building AI-driven systems that automate software engineering tasks, positioning it as an AI-adjacent software engineering role."

The distinction between 'AI-driven systems' and core AI model development is evident. However, the specific AI technologies or models to be used are not detailed, which slightly reduces the confidence in precisely categorizing the AI specialization aspect."
