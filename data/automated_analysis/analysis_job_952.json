It lacks the depth in data engineering, model building, or MLOps typically associated with ML or GenAI Engineer roles. The emphasis is on 'training AI models' through human feedback and 'crafting and answering questions', which aligns with using AI tools for productivity or content generation rather than building AI systems."
