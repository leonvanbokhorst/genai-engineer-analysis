With a solution-oriented and active mindset, you come up with technical solutions, using AI models.\n   Direct solliciteren Neem contact op\n\n   Through your solutions, the data team and the AI team create more business value. In addition to creating business value, knowledge transfer and coaching are also an important part of your job. The goal is to take the engineering skills of your fellow data scientists to the next level, among other things by following best practices.\n\nWhat you are going to do\n\n   You are able to take the lead in devising and designing AI-driven applications. We are currently mainly building state-of-the-art applications with (OpenAI's GPT) LLMs. An important point of attention here is that everything is secure, scalable and repeatable. You will work closely with the Data Scientists to improve the Machine Learning Lifecycle. The focus is on code quality, CI/CD, testing and monitoring. Security is an important part of your application and you are aware of the compliance rules within NN. If you would love to experience an overlap of AI, Software and Data Engineering in your work, then this is your place.\n     * You will develop a scalable solution that will generate email responses to incoming emails using LLM agentic frameworks (Langchain, Langgraph)\n     * You bring AI models (data products) to production, for example in the form of APIs\n     * You develop and maintain the machine learning infrastructure, fitting into the NN landscape\n     * You develop AI applications based on CI/CD, high-quality code, testing and monitoring, Who you will work with\n\n   You will be working in our Competence Center, where we work on applications for the business through projects. Your team includes several data scientists and a machine learning engineer. You will work closely with your fellow machine learning engineer. We also work with various end-to-end teams, all of which exchange specialist knowledge. In this way, we work very efficiently on scalable solutions. In this process, we learn a lot from each other. Our ambition is to become even better at AI.\n\n   Together we work on state-of-the-art solutions, in Python and in the (Azure) cloud. In your work, you experience a lot of freedom and responsibility. That ensures that you continue to grow. In the team we work hybrid, where we meet together at the office at least once a week.",
