            "profile": "Ambiguous",
            "rationale": "The job description focuses on a Solutions Engineer role, emphasizing client relationships, technical demonstrations, and pre-sales activities. While it mentions data science, analytics, and Spark programming, it does not delve into the core responsibilities of developing, training, or deploying AI/ML models, nor does it heavily feature generative AI technologies. The primary focus is on understanding customer needs and showcasing the capabilities of the Databricks platform, which aligns more with a pre-sales technical role rather than a dedicated ML or GenAI engineering position. It also mentions using AI tools to enhance productivity, which is a characteristic of the 'Ambiguous' profile."
