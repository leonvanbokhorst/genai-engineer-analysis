Phrases like 'AI as their co-pilot', 'elevating your coding skills', 'crafting AI tools that clarify complex concepts', and 'Showcasing the power of AI in improving software development processes' indicate a focus on AI-assisted development rather than specialized AI engineering roles like ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer. There is a lack of specific technical details regarding model building, training, or deployment of generative models, which are hallmarks of the ML Engineer and GenAI Engineer profiles."
