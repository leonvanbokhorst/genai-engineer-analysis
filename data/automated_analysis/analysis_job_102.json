            "profile": "Ambiguous",
            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on backend software engineering, cloud-native development, and distributed systems within a Kubernetes environment. While it mentions catering to 'modern LLM mission-critical applications' and working with 'streaming APIs', it lacks specific details about developing, fine-tuning, or deploying generative models themselves. The core responsibilities and technologies described align more with traditional backend development and cloud infrastructure rather than specialized GenAI engineering tasks like prompt engineering, RAG, or PEFT. Therefore, it falls under the 'Ambiguous' category as it's not a clear technical AI role as defined in the Coding Book, but rather a traditional software engineering role that *supports* AI applications."
