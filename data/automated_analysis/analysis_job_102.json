            "rationale": "The job description focuses on backend software engineering for cloud-native environments and distributed systems, specifically mentioning integration with LLM applications. However, it lacks specific details about generative AI model development, fine-tuning, or advanced prompt engineering, which are core to the GenAI Engineer profile. While it mentions LLM applications, the emphasis is on the backend infrastructure and software development supporting them, rather than the AI modeling itself. It doesn't align with the core responsibilities of an ML Engineer either, as it's not focused on predictive modeling. Therefore, it falls under the 'Ambiguous' category due to its general nature and lack of specific AI engineering tasks."
