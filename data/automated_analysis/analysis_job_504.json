While it mentions GenAI and LLM, it lacks specific details about core generative AI tasks like fine-tuning, RAG, or advanced prompt engineering. The emphasis is on team leadership, architecture design, and Python development within a broader ML context, rather than specialized GenAI engineering. The role appears to be more of a Team Lead for Python/ML development with an AI component, rather than a dedicated GenAI Engineer or ML Engineer focused on model development."
