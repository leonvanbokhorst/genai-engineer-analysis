While it mentions 'AI solutions' and 'LLMs', the core responsibilities described are rooted in software engineering practices (integration, deployment, cloud architecture management, scaling applications). There is no explicit mention of core model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG implementation as primary tasks. The role focuses on operationalizing existing or collaboratively built AI solutions rather than developing the AI models themselves. Therefore, it fits the profile of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines the focus on deployment and productionization of AI solutions, which strongly points towards an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile. However, the mention of 'help build new AI solutions' and 'exploring and applying new technology' could imply some involvement in model development, though it's not detailed. The confidence is high but not absolute due to this slight ambiguity."
