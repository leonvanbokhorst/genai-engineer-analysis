        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on traditional ML tasks such as designing, developing, and implementing predictive models, algorithms (computer vision, regression, classification, optimization), and conducting experiments for model comparison and feasibility. While there is a mention of integrating AI solutions into business processes (1.A.1), the core responsibilities and the examples provided (1.B.1) are overwhelmingly aligned with traditional Machine Learning rather than Generative AI. There are no explicit mentions of LLMs, RAG, or GenAI-specific frameworks. The soft skills identified (communication, learning) are supportive but do not shift the core task focus. Therefore, the profile of 'ML Specialist (Data Scientist)' is the most appropriate fit."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to traditional ML tasks and soft skills. However, it lacks specific technology mentions, which would have provided further confirmation. The distinction between 'AI Engineer' and 'Data Scientist' is also somewhat blurred, but the task descriptions lean heavily towards traditional ML. The absence of any GenAI-specific terms makes the classification towards 'ML Specialist (Data Scientist)' quite confident, but not a perfect 5 due to the general nature of 'AI Engineer' in the title."
