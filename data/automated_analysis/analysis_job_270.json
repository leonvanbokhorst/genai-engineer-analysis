        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on traditional data engineering tasks such as designing, building, and optimizing data pipelines, managing infrastructure, and collaborating with data scientists and analysts. While it mentions 'generative AI in risk summarization' as a product of ING Analytics, the responsibilities described for the Data Engineer role itself do not involve direct work with GenAI models, prompt engineering, or fine-tuning. The tasks fall squarely within Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering), with no explicit mention of tasks from Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization). Therefore, the profile is 'Software Engineer'."

It explicitly mentions 'generative AI' as a product of the broader department but does not assign GenAI-specific tasks to this particular role. The distinction between the department's offerings and the role's responsibilities is clear, leading to high confidence in the profile assignment."
