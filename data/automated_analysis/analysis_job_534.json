With these AI solutions, we help our business unit Schade & Inkomen to digitize important processes. An example of this is the digitization of our Claims processes. Your main goal is to deploy/roll out the AI solutions of your colleagues/the AI solution made together with your colleagues in a scalable and secure way., In the past year, we have set up various applications using LLMs and we are now looking for an experienced Machine Learning Engineer to further scale these applications and help build new AI solutions. You provide a clear vision of the required Cloud architecture and manage it for our AI solutions. With your solution-oriented and proactive mindset, you help the team scale and make the best AI solution for business problems production-worthy. We work agile with colleagues from the business on projects that are often sprint-transcending.\n\n   In concrete terms, you bring AI solutions to production so that your solutions really create value for our company of tomorrow. Exploring and applying new technology plays an important role. In addition, you actively contribute to innovation within NN. During our monthly innovation day, you investigate with your colleagues which new techniques are applicable within our company., The team you work with on a daily basis consists of a group of data scientists, a small group of software and machine learning professionals, and a program manager who oversees our activities. You will, of course, work closely with the team's data scientist, and together with these colleagues, we work with great enthusiasm and dedication every day to optimize and innovate customer service, processes, and quality.\n\n   In addition, you are a member of the \"Engineering\" guild, where about 400 engineers meet each other. Here, you exchange knowledge and experiences with peers. We believe that every engineer can learn something from their peers, and vice versa. This way, you accelerate your career and deliver maximum value with our AI solutions.\n\n   Onze kantoren zijn 100% circulair gerenoveerd. Zero waste, maar zonder concessies te doen aan het ontwerp.\n\n   Onze in-house 'event space' is hét creatieve centrum voor het delen van kennis.\n\n   Bij NN werken we hybride. Samen met jouw team bepaal jij waar en wanneer je werkt.\n\n   'Ýou Matter', dat is onze merkbelofte.\n\n   Het kantoor is een ontmoetingsplek, met ruimte om te brainstormen en samen te werken.\n\n   Ons hoofdkantoor ter gelegenheid van het event: 'Den Haag Stad Escher' in 2023.\n\n   Wij delen dit graag met elkaar.\n\n   Wij geloven in de kracht van kunst en zijn trotse partner van het Mauritshuis.",
