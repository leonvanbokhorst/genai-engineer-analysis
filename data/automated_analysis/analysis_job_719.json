            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on pre-sales, customer relationship management, and demonstrating a platform's value rather than hands-on development, implementation, or deep technical problem-solving within AI/ML. While it mentions Data Science/Generative AI/Machine Learning or Data Engineering as a background, the core responsibilities are centered around technical pre-sales and solution architecture advisory, not the direct creation or deployment of AI models or systems. The emphasis on 'demonstrate how our Databricks Data Intelligence Platform can help customers solve their complex data challenges' and 'technical customer-facing' roles points towards a sales-engineering or solutions architect role that leverages AI/ML knowledge, rather than an engineer who builds AI/ML systems. The role is more about selling and advising on existing solutions rather than developing new ones."
