            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on Azure Systems Engineering, DevOps, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC), with a mention of exploring GenAI, LLM, and Copilots. However, the core responsibilities and required skills are centered around cloud infrastructure management and traditional software development practices, rather than the core development, fine-tuning, or deployment of generative AI models. Therefore, it does not fit the 'GenAI Engineer' or 'ML Engineer' profiles and is best classified as 'Ambiguous' as it is a technical role but not directly focused on AI model development."
