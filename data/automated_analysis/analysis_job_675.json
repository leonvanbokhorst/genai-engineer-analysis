While AI and GenAI (specifically RAG and GPT-4) are mentioned as key components and tools to be used, the primary focus remains on building and modernizing software products with AI as an integrated element. The role involves developing AI-powered features within existing product lines rather than focusing solely on model development or AI research. The tasks are predominantly from Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration), with some mention of AI specialization tasks (RAG, GPT-4). This aligns best with the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."
