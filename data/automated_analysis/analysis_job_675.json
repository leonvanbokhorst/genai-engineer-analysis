        "Functieomschrijving": "Are you an exceptional Unity game developer with a passion for engineering excellence? Join us at LearnWith.AI as we integrate AI into learning, creating cutting-edge educational experiences. We're seeking a Unity developer with outstanding engineering skills to implement games that push the boundaries of educational technology.\n\n   Your role will be pivotal in developing Magic Academy-a game where knowledge isn't just taught, it's experienced. You'll be responsible for creating sophisticated metaphors that visualize students' knowledge, turning abstract information into tangible, interactive experiences. This isn't just about identifying gaps in learning; it's about building robust, scalable solutions that create immersive learning adventures.\n\n   What we offer:\n     * The chance to work with cutting-edge technologies in education and game development,\n     * A platform to showcase your engineering prowess, directly impacting how students learn,\n     * A dynamic environment where technical innovation is not just encouraged but required.\n\n   We're looking for engineers who can deliver solutions at the highest level of quality. If you're passionate about creating robust, efficient, and maintainable code that meets the most rigorous engineering standards, we want to hear from you. Join us in revolutionizing education through cutting-edge game development!\n\n   What you will be doing\n\n     * Implementing interactive games that integrate AI and real-time data processing,\n     * Writing high-performance, scalable, high-quality code that adheres to best practices in software engineering,\n     * Collaborating with cross-functional teams to translate complex educational concepts into elegant technical solutions,\n     * Implementing robust integrations with third-party APIs and cloud-based services.\n\n   What you will NOT be doing\n\n     * Getting stuck in endless approval loops - we value swift decision-making and engineering autonomy,\n     * Focusing primarily on game design or visual aesthetics - while important, our priority is engineering excellence,\n     * Writing code that merely 'works' without considering scalability, maintainability, and performance,\n     * Isolated tasks - you will collaborate closely with a supportive product and backend team., * Delivering high-quality, performant game systems that serve as the primary interface for students in our online learning environment,\n     * Continuously improving and optimizing our codebase to meet evolving educational and technological needs.",
