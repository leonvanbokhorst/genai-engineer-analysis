        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on tasks related to training and evaluating generative AI models, specifically by creating and answering questions and evaluating generated code. These tasks fall under Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization). There are no explicit mentions of core software engineering tasks (Macro-Category A) like building applications, developing APIs, or managing MLOps pipelines. Therefore, the role is best classified as a GenAI Specialist."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines tasks related to training and evaluating generative AI models. However, it lacks specific technical tool mentions and detailed descriptions of the software engineering aspects that would be present in a 'Core GenAI Engineer' role. The focus is primarily on the AI model interaction and feedback loop, making the 'GenAI Specialist' profile the most fitting, but the absence of explicit software engineering tasks prevents a perfect score."
