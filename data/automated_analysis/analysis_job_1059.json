While it mentions AI/ML toolkits, the core focus leans towards the engineering and operationalization of traditional ML models rather than generative AI applications. The mention of guiding junior developers in AI/ML and working with clients on ML strategies further supports a profile centered on the practical application and deployment of ML."
