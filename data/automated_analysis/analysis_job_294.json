While it mentions 'generative AI models' and 'large language models', it does not involve the development, fine-tuning, or deployment of these models themselves, nor does it require traditional ML engineering tasks like algorithm development or productionizing models. The core activity is human feedback for AI training, which aligns with the definition of 'Ambiguous' as a role primarily focused on the *use* of AI tools to enhance productivity or data generation, rather than core AI engineering or development."
