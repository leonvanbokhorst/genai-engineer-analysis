Software Development & Integration), focusing on designing, developing, and maintaining existing software (NX CAM). No tasks related to AI model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, RAG, or traditional ML are mentioned. The technologies listed are C++ and NX CAM, neither of which are AI/ML specific tools. Therefore, the role is classified as a Software Engineer as it does not involve building or integrating AI/ML into the product, despite the 'AI' in the title."

While the title includes 'AI', the description of duties and technologies does not support an AI-focused role. The distinction between a Software Engineer and an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer is clear based on the absence of AI/ML integration tasks. The analysis is straightforward based on the provided coding book."
