            "rationale": "The job description focuses on 'Intelligent Automation' and 'robotic engineering' using tools like UiPath, with mentions of AI and Machine Learning, and GenAI/NLP. However, it lacks the depth and specific focus on core ML model development, advanced generative model fine-tuning, or building complex AI-driven applications that would align with 'ML Engineer' or 'GenAI Engineer'. The primary tasks involve monitoring, fixing issues in existing robots, and collaborating with business leaders, which are more aligned with automation and process improvement rather than core AI/ML engineering roles. The role is also an internship, suggesting a learning and support function rather than independent development of advanced AI systems. Therefore, it falls under 'Ambiguous' as it's primarily focused on the application and maintenance of automation tools, with AI/GenAI being components of that automation, rather than the core focus of building AI models or systems from scratch."
