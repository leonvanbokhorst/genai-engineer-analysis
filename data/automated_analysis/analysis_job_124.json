The tasks described, such as managing Linux environments, writing configuration management scripts (Puppet, Ansible), and functional testing, do not align with the core responsibilities of an ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer. The mention of 'Modelling CI/CD deployment' and 'Creating designs and models' appears to refer to system architecture and deployment pipelines, not AI/ML models. Therefore, it is not an AI-related technical role."
