The emphasis is on building and deploying AI systems, with specific mention of GenAI tools, fitting the 'Core GenAI Engineer' profile."

However, it lacks explicit mention of frameworks like LangChain or RAG, which would solidify the 'GenAI' aspect further. The mention of 'AI automations' and 'GPT-4 Vision' strongly suggests GenAI, but the overall description could be more specific about the nature of the AI systems being built."
