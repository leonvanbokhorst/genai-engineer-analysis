At Sqills, we'll support you every step of the way as you:\n     * Apply your Python experience on the job, while building exciting AI-powered tools.\n     * Work on a mission-critical SaaS platform used by international customers for inventory, reservation, and ticketing.\n     * Collaborate with a team of passionate developers who are happy to share their knowledge and help you grow.\n     * Experiment with innovative technologies and shape the future of Generative AI in real-world applications.\n\nWhat you'll be doing\n\n   As part of an Agile DevOps team, you'll take ownership of your work and grow alongside talented peers. Your responsibilities will include:\n     * Developing Generative AI-powered tools that enhance internal processes and uncover new possibilities for S3 Passenger. For example: improving our intelligent AI powered chat bot so users are able to find answers quickly based on our internal documentation.\n     * Designing and implementing backend microservices in the AWS Cloud using AWS Bedrock with Anthropic Claude models to support high-performance and scalable systems.\n     * Learning Python while applying it to meaningful, real-world projects. For example: using AI chat bots instead of complex wizards in our S3 Passenger product for configuration.\n     * Collaborating to design secure, high-quality, and maintainable software.\n     * Debugging and optimising systems using tools like New Relic, Sentry, and other monitoring platforms.\n\nWhat makes us different\n\n   At Sqills, we focus on growth, quality, and collaboration. Here's what you can expect:\n     * Learn as you go: No prior AI experience? No problem. We'll provide the tools and mentorship you need to succeed.\n     * Tools and technologies: Start with what you know and expand your skill set to include other programming languages like Golang and AWS services like Lambda and DynamoDB.\n     * Infrastructure excellence: Work with OpenTofu, Kubernetes, and AWS Cloud Development Kit to build Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) solutions.\n     * Hands-on experience with AI: Experiment with Generative AI and apply it to real-world challenges.\n     * Supportive culture: A company that values growth, creativity, and knowledge sharing.",
