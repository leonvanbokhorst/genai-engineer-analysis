While it involves data engineering and operational tasks (1.A.2, 1.B.3), there is no mention of AI/ML model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or any specific AI/ML tasks. The role is purely data infrastructure and management focused, not AI/ML development or specialization. Therefore, it does not fit any of the AI/ML-related profiles and is classified as 'Not Relevant'."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is clear about its focus on data engineering and infrastructure management within a big data environment. There is a complete absence of any AI or ML specific tasks or technologies, making the classification straightforward. The role is clearly defined as a data engineer supporting research, not an AI/ML role."
