            "rationale": "The job description focuses on designing and refining AI tools to enhance customer service, including predicting client needs and automating responses. However, it lacks specific technical details about model development, deep learning frameworks, or advanced AI engineering tasks. The emphasis is on the application and integration of AI tools within a customer support context, rather than the core development or engineering of AI models themselves. The responsibilities lean towards using and integrating existing AI solutions to improve service operations and training teams on these tools, which aligns more with a business or application-focused role rather than a specialized ML or GenAI Engineer role. The mention of 'AI tools' and 'AI technologies' without specifying generative models or complex ML algorithms, combined with a strong focus on customer service enhancement and team education, points towards an 'Ambiguous' classification as it doesn't fit the core definitions of ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer."
