            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on mobile application development (iOS, Swift) and integrating AI features into an existing app. While it mentions 'generative AI' and 'harnessing its power to free our engineers from routine tasks,' it does not detail core Generative AI engineering tasks such as fine-tuning LLMs, building RAG systems, or advanced prompt engineering. The primary focus remains on traditional mobile development and using AI as a feature, rather than building AI systems themselves. Therefore, it does not align with the core responsibilities of an ML Engineer or a GenAI Engineer as defined in the coding book."
