        "assigned_profile": "AI-Adjacent Software Engineer",
        "rationale": "The job ad heavily emphasizes traditional software engineering tasks (1.A.1) such as developing back-end solutions, integrating features, building widgets, optimizing functionality, and conducting code reviews. While it mentions AI and generative AI, the focus is on integrating these into existing products and improving software development processes, rather than deep AI model development or specialization. The tasks are predominantly in Macro-Category A, with AI being a component integrated into the software. The mention of RAG and GPT-4 indicates some AI specialization, but it's framed within the context of software integration. The role is not focused on traditional ML (Core ML Engineer, ML Specialist) or solely on AI tasks (GenAI Specialist). Therefore, 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' best describes a role that builds software that uses AI as a core feature."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines many software development tasks and mentions specific AI technologies like RAG and GPT-4. The primary focus is on integrating AI into existing product lines and improving software development efficiency. The role is well-defined as a back-end developer role that leverages AI. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the balance between 'AI-driven innovations' and core software development could be interpreted slightly differently, but the overall emphasis leans heavily towards software engineering."
