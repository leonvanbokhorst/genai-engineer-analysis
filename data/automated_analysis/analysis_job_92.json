It also includes developing 'end-to-end solutions' and 'robust solutions that are used in production' (1.A.1, 1.A.2), indicating software engineering and operationalization aspects. The mention of 'deep learning technologies' is present but not as the primary focus. There is no mention of Generative AI specific tasks like LLMs, RAG, or prompt engineering. Therefore, the role aligns best with a 'Core ML Engineer' profile due to the emphasis on traditional ML tasks and the inclusion of software engineering practices."

        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the tasks involving traditional ML (predictive models, statistical models) and the development of end-to-end solutions for production. It lacks specific mention of Generative AI technologies, making the distinction clear. The confidence is high, but not perfect (5), as the term 'deep learning' could sometimes overlap with modern AI, but the context strongly suggests traditional ML applications."
