            "rationale": "The job description focuses on integrating AI, 3D, and motion production innovations to streamline workflows and develop new capabilities within a studio environment. While it mentions AI and GenAI, it lacks specific details about core AI/ML engineering tasks such as model development, training, or deployment of predictive or generative models. The emphasis is on workflow optimization, automation solutions, and integrating existing tools rather than building or fine-tuning AI models themselves. This aligns more with a role that leverages AI for production enhancement rather than a core AI development role."
