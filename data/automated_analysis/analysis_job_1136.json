        "rationale": "The job primarily focuses on integrating AI capabilities into customer support systems and improving existing AI models through feedback and fine-tuning. While there's mention of AI model fine-tuning, the core responsibility appears to be the application and integration of AI within a support framework, rather than deep model development or research. The tasks lean more towards using and enhancing AI as part of a broader system (customer support) rather than building AI from the ground up. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities related to AI integration and improvement within a customer support context. The tasks are specific enough to categorize, although the 'AI model fine-tuning' aspect could be interpreted in different ways. The emphasis on rapid ramp-up and self-sufficiency also provides clear soft skill indicators. The profile assignment is reasonably confident based on the described blend of tasks."
