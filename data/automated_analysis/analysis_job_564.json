While it mentions AI, ML, and LLM as technologies used by the company, the core responsibilities and required skills for this specific role do not align with the technical depth expected of an ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer. The role is primarily business and project management-oriented, with a focus on using AI/ML as tools rather than developing or engineering them. Therefore, it falls under the 'Ambiguous' category as it's not a technical AI development role."
