We're looking for innovative thinkers who can seamlessly integrate AI across both front-end and back-end systems, taking ownership of the entire product. Your work will directly impact thousands of students, ensuring that our tools meet their needs and set new standards for educational technology., * Develop AI-Powered Web Applications: Architect and code sophisticated web applications that integrate both front-end and back-end components, with a focus on enhancing user experience through AI.\n     * Experiment and Innovate with AI: Work with cutting-edge AI technologies, specifically large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 or Claude, to create autonomous tools and interactive features that redefine how students learn.\n     * Drive Technical Projects: Take ownership of the entire development process, from gathering requirements to launching and iterating on products. You'll work closely with stakeholders to ensure that our solutions meet learner needs and push the boundaries of what's possible.\n     * Collaborate and Communicate: Partner with a global team of developers, designers, and educational experts. Your ability to communicate complex ideas simply and effectively will be key to your success.\n     * Continuous Improvement: Stay ahead of the curve by continually learning and applying the latest advancements in AI and web development to our platform.\n\n   What you will NOT be doing\n\n     * Narrow AI Development: You won't be working on isolated AI features that don't integrate with the overall product strategy. Your work will have a direct impact on thousands of students.\n     * Surface-Level Coding: This is not a role for those who focus only on either front-end or back-end development. You will be expected to integrate both, creating comprehensive and scalable solutions.\n     * Routine Maintenance: This role is not about maintaining legacy systems or making minor updates. You will be driving innovation and building new, cutting-edge applications.\n     * Waiting for Detailed Specifications: You won't be handed fully fleshed-out requirements. Instead, you will take high-level ideas and translate them into fully developed products, leveraging your expertise in AI and full-stack development.\n     * Working in Isolation: You won't be coding in a vacuum. Collaboration with other developers, product managers, and educational experts is key to ensuring that the solutions you build are impactful and user-centered., Develop and deliver engaging, human-centered AI applications that demonstrably accelerate learning outcomes and efficiency for thousands of K-12 students.",
