We're looking for someone eager to use AI to craft intelligent, forward-thinking solutions that will bring our 100+ product portfolio into the modern world.\n\n   At Trilogy's core, we have a strategic product line reshaping industries and how people work and learn. Here's a glimpse of our strategic product line:\n     * AdvocateHub: Integrate an AI-powered bot using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach with OpenAI's GPT-4. You'll develop a seamless sidebar widget, implement feature flags, and build a robust logging mechanism to capture KPIs. Sharpen your skills in AI integration, UI/UX design, and data-driven development.\n     * Jive Cloud: Build a game-changing AI feature using generative AI and the Jive REST API. You'll leverage AI interactions within existing user activities, abstract the AI provider for flexibility, and optimize search functionality. Grow your expertise in AI architecture, API design, and performance optimization.\n     * ACRM: Develop a cutting-edge CRM solution that seamlessly integrates sales, marketing, and support into a sophisticated, user-friendly interface. You'll work on building advanced data analytics modules, implementing machine learning algorithms for predictive insights, and creating intuitive data visualization tools. Expand your skill set in data engineering, AI/ML, and UI/UX design while creating a platform that drives customer success.\n\n   In this role, you can expect to navigate the complexities of integrating AI-driven solutions into these exciting product lines, offering unique opportunities to innovate. Your expertise will guide the development of scalable, serverless applications and innovative features, leveraging the full potential of cloud-native technologies.\n\n   Here's what you can expect from our application process:\n     * A quick check: Answer a few yes/no questions to confirm you meet the basic requirements.\n     * Prove your potential: Take a 15-minute cognitive assessment (the Criteria CCAT), scientifically proven to be the best predictor of success in roles that require rapidly gaining and applying new knowledge.\n     * Showcase your skills: Demonstrate your coding prowess by writing, testing, and refactoring code, developing new features with AI, and collaborating with AI to diagnose and solve problems.\n     * Connect with leadership: Engage in a 30-minute Google Meet interview with a member of our Engineering leadership team.\n\n   This comprehensive process takes approximately 5 hours, which you can complete at your own pace. We value your time and effort, so we'll provide the results of each assessment within 24 hours of completion and interview decisions within 3 business days.\n\n   Are you up for the challenge? Trilogy is for the brave, the curious, and the forward-thinking. We're remapping the world of work with AI as our compass. Ready to join the journey?\n\n   What you will be doing\n\n     * Leverage cutting-edge AI tools to improve efficiency in coding, error detection, feature development, bug fixing etc.\n     * Modernize our strategic product lines through AI-driven innovations, enhancing performance, scalability, and user engagement.\n     * Develop and deploy efficient back-end solutions using serverless technologies, focusing on creating robust, cloud-native applications.\n     * Conduct comprehensive code reviews and collaborate with a global team to ensure best practices and high standards. Crafting AI 2nd Brains -AI-driven summaries of product, domain, or company knowledge\n     * -making you and your team smarter and faster.\n     * Becoming an AI pioneer leading the charge in integrating AI into software engineering, proving it's a force multiplier, not a replacement.\n\n   What you will NOT be doing\n\n     * Routine Monotony: We keep cumbersome infrastructure tasks to a minimum so you can focus on creating innovative solutions.\n     * Endless Meetings: We value your expertise in development over sitting in meeting rooms. Expect more coding, less talking., Enhance product functionality and effectively integrate AI-driven solutions into our cloud services.",
