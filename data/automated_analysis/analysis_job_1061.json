While it mentions integrating AI models, the core tasks are about building and connecting systems rather than developing or fine-tuning AI models themselves (Macro-Category B). The tools mentioned are primarily no-code platforms and traditional data tools, not AI-specific frameworks or models. Therefore, it aligns best with the 'Software Engineer' profile, as it's about building software that might *use* AI, but not about the AI development itself."

The mention of AI is in the context of integration rather than core AI development. The profile assignment is straightforward based on the dominance of Macro-Category A tasks. A slightly lower score is given because the AI aspect is present but not deeply detailed, leaving a small room for interpretation regarding the depth of AI involvement."
