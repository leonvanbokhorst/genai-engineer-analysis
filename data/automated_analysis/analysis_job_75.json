While Conversational AI (LLM, NLP, ASR, TTS) is mentioned, the core focus is on the underlying ML architecture and optimization techniques rather than building user-facing applications with generative models. The role involves working with large-scale multi-node ML models and interacting with the scientific community, aligning more with core ML research and engineering than a GenAI Engineer role which typically focuses on fine-tuning and deploying LLMs for specific applications."
