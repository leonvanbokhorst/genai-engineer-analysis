            "rationale": "The job description focuses on a 'Middle Python developer with NLP experience' and mentions integration with project management tools. While NLP implies some AI/ML knowledge, there's no mention of generative models, LLMs, RAG, fine-tuning, or specific AI/ML engineering tasks like model training, deployment, or MLOps. The core focus appears to be on Python development within a project management software context, making it lean towards traditional software engineering or a role that uses NLP as a tool rather than building core AI systems. Therefore, it does not fit the specific criteria for ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer and is classified as Ambiguous."
