While AI tools are mentioned as a means to achieve these goals, the core responsibilities do not involve developing or fine-tuning AI models themselves (Macro-Category B). The role focuses on using AI as a tool within a software engineering context, aligning with the definition of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines responsibilities that are primarily software engineering and operations-focused, using AI as a tool. It explicitly states it's not a traditional engineering or support role but combines technical work with AI tools. The distinction between using AI tools and developing AI models is clear, leading to a high confidence in the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile. The only minor ambiguity is the classification of 'AI tools' which could be interpreted broadly, but the context points to their use in operational tasks."
