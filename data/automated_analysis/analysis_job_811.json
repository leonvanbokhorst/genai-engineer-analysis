            "rationale": "The job description focuses on applying AI/ML to cyber defense and mentions 'AI-powered security platform' and 'ML/GenAI', but the core responsibilities and technologies described lean heavily towards traditional software engineering and security solutions rather than the development or fine-tuning of AI models themselves. The role emphasizes building and scaling security platforms and services, leveraging AI models as a component, but not developing or deeply understanding the AI models' inner workings. The primary focus is on the application of AI within a security context, not on AI development itself, which aligns with the 'Ambiguous' profile's criteria for roles primarily focused on the use of AI tools to enhance productivity or traditional engineering roles."
