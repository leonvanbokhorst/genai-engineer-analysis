However, the mention of 'GENAI Studio' in the title, coupled with responsibilities like 'business related data governance processes', 'technical implementation and maintenance of data processing services and storage systems', and 'implementation and maintenance of ML governance processes', suggests a broader scope that includes building and maintaining systems around AI models. While not explicitly mentioning LLMs or RAG, the context of a 'GENAI Studio' and the focus on end-to-end ownership of ML systems points towards the GenAI Engineer profile, which encompasses building and deploying AI-powered applications."
