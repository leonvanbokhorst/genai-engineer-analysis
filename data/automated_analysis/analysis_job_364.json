It also includes significant tasks in model development and fine-tuning (1.B.1) and data engineering for NLP pipelines (1.B.3). While there is one mention of integrating ML solutions into platforms (1.A.1), the core focus is on the AI/GenAI specialization. The role is not purely a specialist as it involves integration, but the specialization is clearly GenAI rather than traditional ML. Therefore, 'Core GenAI Engineer' is the most fitting profile."
