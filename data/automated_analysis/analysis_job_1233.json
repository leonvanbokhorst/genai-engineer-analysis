        "assigned_profile": "Core GenAI Engineer",
        "rationale": "The job ad emphasizes deploying and scaling AI solutions (MLOps/DevOps) using LLMs, which are core Generative AI technologies. It also mentions setting up applications using LLMs and helping build new AI solutions, indicating involvement in both software integration and potentially model development. The role requires a clear vision of cloud architecture for AI solutions and a solution-oriented mindset to make them production-worthy and create business value. While there's a strong focus on deployment and operations (Macro-Category A), the explicit mention of LLMs and AI solutions suggests a significant component of Generative AI specialization (Macro-Category B). The balance leans towards a Core GenAI Engineer due to the explicit focus on LLMs and the deployment/scaling of these specific AI solutions."

    "confidence": {
        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly indicates a focus on AI solutions, LLMs, deployment, and scaling, which are key indicators for GenAI roles. The mention of 'Azure Genai DevOps Engineer' in the title strongly supports this. However, the depth of involvement in actual model development versus integration/deployment is not fully detailed, preventing a perfect score. The emphasis on 'deploy/roll out' and 'manage cloud architecture' leans heavily towards MLOps, but the context of LLMs firmly places it within GenAI."
