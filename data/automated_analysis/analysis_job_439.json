            "profile": "Ambiguous",
            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on the use of AI as a tool to enhance existing software development processes and productivity, rather than on the core development, fine-tuning, or deployment of AI models themselves. Phrases like 'AI as their co-pilot,' 'elevating your coding skills,' 'crafting AI tools that clarify complex concepts,' and 'emphasizing its role as a booster, not a replacement' suggest a focus on AI-assisted development rather than specialized AI engineering roles like ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer. There is a lack of specific technical details regarding model building, training, or deployment of generative models, which are central to the GenAI Engineer profile. Similarly, while it mentions enhancing software development, it doesn't emphasize the data-driven algorithmic work characteristic of an ML Engineer. The role appears to be more about leveraging AI for general software engineering productivity."
