While 'GenAI features' are mentioned as part of the devices powered, the core responsibilities and tasks (security research, red-teaming, vulnerability discovery, proposing solutions, automation of security work) are firmly rooted in software engineering and security assurance (Macro-Category A). There are no tasks described that involve the development, fine-tuning, or prompt engineering of GenAI models themselves (Macro-Category B). Therefore, the role is classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, as it integrates security practices into software development, and the mention of GenAI is contextual to the product rather than the core function of the role."

        "score": 5,
        "reasoning": "The job advertisement is very clear about the core responsibilities, which are centered around offensive security engineering and assurance within the context of hardware and software development for devices. While GenAI is mentioned, it's in the context of the devices' features, not as a core technology to be developed or manipulated by the candidate. The tasks clearly fall under Macro-Category A, making the profile assignment straightforward."
