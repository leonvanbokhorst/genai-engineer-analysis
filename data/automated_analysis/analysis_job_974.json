        "rationale": "The job ad focuses exclusively on tasks related to training and evaluating generative AI models ('train AI models', 'train generative artificial intelligence models', 'Evaluating and ranking code generated by AI models'). While it mentions 'experienced software engineer', the core responsibilities described fall under Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization) and are specific to generative AI, with no mention of traditional software development (Macro-Category A) or traditional ML tasks. Therefore, 'GenAI Specialist' is the most appropriate profile."
