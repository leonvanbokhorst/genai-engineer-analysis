            "rationale": "The job description focuses on using AI models to generate and evaluate code, rather than building, fine-tuning, or deploying AI models themselves. The core tasks involve crafting questions and evaluating AI-generated code, which aligns more with AI model training and evaluation from a user perspective rather than engineering. There is a lack of emphasis on core AI engineering tasks like model development, MLOps, or building AI-powered applications, and the role is described as 'freelance' and 'remote' with flexible hours, suggesting it's not a core engineering position. The mention of 'Big Data Engineer for AI Training' is also misleading as the described tasks do not involve traditional big data engineering."
