        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on 'Prompt Engineering' and developing 'AI assistant technologies' (Macro-Category B, GenAI Specialization). While there are mentions of 'design and implement scalable GenAI solutions' and 'testing and validation' (Macro-Category A, Software Development & Integration), these tasks are in service of the core GenAI specialization. The role is not primarily about building the underlying software infrastructure but rather about crafting and refining the AI interactions themselves. Therefore, 'GenAI Specialist' is the most fitting profile."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite clear about the core responsibilities, particularly highlighting 'Prompt Engineering'. However, it lacks specific details on the technologies used or the depth of the software engineering tasks involved, which prevents a perfect score. The profile assignment is strongly supported by the explicit mention of Prompt Engineering."
