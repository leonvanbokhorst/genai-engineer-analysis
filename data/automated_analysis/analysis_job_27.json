            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on front-end development and user interface aspects, with a mention of 'generative AI' as the underlying technology. However, it lacks details on core AI engineering tasks such as model development, fine-tuning, RAG implementation, or MLOps. The primary focus is on exposing existing functionality to customers and exploring new interfaces, which aligns more with traditional software development or a role that consumes AI services rather than builds them. Therefore, it does not fit the criteria for ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer and is classified as Ambiguous."
