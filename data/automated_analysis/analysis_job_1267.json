            "rationale": "The job description emphasizes leading software delivery and integration of GenAI components, but lacks specific details on core GenAI engineering tasks like fine-tuning, RAG development, or advanced prompt engineering. While it mentions GenAI technology, the focus is on the 'delivery' and 'integration' aspects within a broader software engineering context, and the requirement for adaptability and learning on the job suggests it might not require deep pre-existing GenAI expertise. The role seems more focused on managing the application of GenAI rather than the deep technical development of GenAI models themselves, leaning towards a traditional software engineering lead role with exposure to GenAI."
