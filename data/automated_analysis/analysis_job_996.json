While it mentions 'generative AI models' and 'large language models', the core tasks described do not involve building, fine-tuning, or deploying these models. Instead, it emphasizes the use of AI tools to enhance productivity and the role of a 'coder' in providing feedback, aligning with the definition of the 'Ambiguous' profile which includes roles primarily focused on the use of AI tools to enhance productivity or roles not directly involved in AI development."
