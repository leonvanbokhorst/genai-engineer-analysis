        "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on customer service operations, strategy, and the integration/improvement of tools and solutions within organizations. While it mentions 'generative AI' as an example technology for innovation, the core responsibilities are centered around software integration, customer success, and business operations (Macro-Category A). There are no explicit tasks related to model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG (Macro-Category B). Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, where AI is a tool for enhancement rather than the core focus of development."

The mention of 'generative AI' is illustrative rather than a core requirement for model building. The tasks clearly lean towards software integration and business strategy, making the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile a strong fit. A perfect score is not given as the mention of 'generative AI' could be interpreted slightly differently, but the overall context strongly supports the chosen profile."
