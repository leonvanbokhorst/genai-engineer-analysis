            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on Azure Systems Engineering, Infrastructure as Code, CI/CD pipelines, and scripting for infrastructure management. While it mentions an interest in exploring GenAI, LLM, and Copilots, these are presented as areas for future exploration rather than core responsibilities. The primary duties align with traditional cloud infrastructure and DevOps roles, not with the core responsibilities of developing, fine-tuning, or deploying generative AI models. Therefore, it does not fit the 'GenAI Engineer' or 'ML Engineer' profiles and is best classified as 'Ambiguous' as it's not a technical AI role."
