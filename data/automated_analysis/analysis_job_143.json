It emphasizes uptime, automation tooling, and providing flexible infrastructure up to the OS and Kubernetes layer. While it mentions a 'DevOps mindset' and working with other teams, there is no mention of AI, machine learning, generative models, or related technologies. The core responsibilities are clearly in infrastructure and operations, not AI development or application building, making it a non-technical role in the context of AI/ML."
