While the role is within an 'AI-First' team and mentions utilizing 'AI tools and methodologies to automate repetitive tasks, boost configuration efficiency,' these are described as productivity enhancements for the developer rather than the integration of AI/ML features into the final product. There are no tasks described that fall into Macro-Category B (GenAI Specialization). Given that the core responsibilities are purely within Macro-Category A and the AI mention refers to productivity tools, the `Software Engineer` profile is the most appropriate classification."

The mention of AI is framed as a tool for developer efficiency rather than a core product feature. The 'AI-First' branding is the only element that introduces slight ambiguity, but the specific tasks described do not involve AI model development or integration. Therefore, confidence is high that it is a software engineering role utilizing AI tools."
