While it mentions working with LLMs like GPT-4 and Claude, the core focus is on integrating these AI capabilities into broader web applications and taking ownership of the entire product development lifecycle. The role is not primarily about model development or deep AI research, but rather about building software that leverages AI. This aligns best with the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile, where the majority of tasks fall under Macro-Category A (Software Development & Integration), with AI being a key component integrated into the software."
