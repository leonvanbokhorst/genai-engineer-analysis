Are you afraid your hard skills will atrophy if you continue spending most of your day on low-skill tasks? Jigsaw is revolutionizing consulting by harnessing the power of AI to cut through the noise and let you focus on what truly matters: delivering high-impact results for clients. If you're driven by innovation and want to be at the forefront of AI-enhanced project delivery, this role is tailor-made for you.\n\n   Jigsaw is fundamentally rethinking how projects are delivered, using generative AI to automate the mundane and elevate the strategic. Say goodbye to the grind of manual configuration, which you are overqualified to do anyway, and hello to a world where AI does the heavy lifting, freeing you to focus on building systems and delivering unparalleled client service.\n\n   This isn't your average consulting gig.

While it mentions 'generative AI' and 'AI-enhanced project delivery,' it explicitly states 'Coding or programming' is not part of the role, and there's no mention of core AI engineering tasks like model training, algorithm development, or MLOps. The emphasis is on business understanding, client service, and leveraging existing AI capabilities, aligning more with a business-focused or AI-tool-user role rather than a technical AI engineering profile."
