        "rationale": "The job ad focuses heavily on designing, building, and implementing cloud and AI solutions, which falls under Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering). While AI is mentioned, there are no specific tasks or technologies related to GenAI specialization (Macro-Category B) like model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. The role appears to be about building and managing AI solutions within a broader cloud engineering context, rather than specializing in the AI/ML models themselves. Therefore, it fits the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "score": 4,
        "reasoning": "The job ad is quite concise. While it clearly indicates a software engineering focus with AI integration, it lacks specific details about the AI technologies or models involved, which would have allowed for a higher confidence score. The mention of 'GenAI Acceleration Team' suggests a GenAI focus, but the responsibilities listed are general enough to be applicable to broader AI integration."
