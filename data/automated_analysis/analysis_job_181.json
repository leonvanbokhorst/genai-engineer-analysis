While it mentions 'AI-based enterprise applications' and the 'C3 AI Platform', it does not detail specific AI/ML model development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or RAG. The core responsibilities are focused on building and maintaining software that *uses* AI, rather than developing the AI models themselves. Therefore, it aligns best with an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines software engineering responsibilities. The mention of 'AI-based' and 'C3 AI Platform' indicates AI integration, but lacks specifics on AI model development, making it lean towards an adjacent role rather than a core AI/ML role. The confidence is high for the software engineering aspects but moderate for the precise AI specialization due to the lack of detail on AI model tasks."
