            "rationale": "The job description focuses on using AI models to write better code and involves crafting questions and evaluating AI-generated code. While it mentions 'generative AI models' and 'large language models', it lacks the core responsibilities and technical depth expected of an ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer, such as model development, fine-tuning, RAG systems, or productionizing AI systems. The role appears to be more about human feedback for AI training rather than building or engineering AI systems, aligning with the 'use of AI tools to enhance productivity' aspect of the Ambiguous profile."
