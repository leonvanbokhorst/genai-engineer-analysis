While it mentions 'generative AI' as an area of development, it lacks specific details about building, fine-tuning, or deploying generative models, RAG systems, or advanced prompt engineering. The core responsibilities described align more with a senior software engineer role that might *incorporate* AI, rather than a specialized GenAI Engineer or ML Engineer role focused on model development and deployment."
