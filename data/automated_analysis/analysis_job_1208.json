            "rationale": "The job description focuses heavily on traditional software development, data engineering (ETL, data warehousing), and MLOps principles within a banking context. While it mentions 'big data' and 'calculations', there is no explicit mention of machine learning models, generative AI, or predictive analytics. The core technologies listed (Java, Oracle, Linux, Kafka, Azure DevOps) are standard for enterprise software development and data engineering, not specifically AI/ML roles. The emphasis is on building and maintaining robust, secure, and scalable software systems for credit risk, rather than developing or deploying AI models. Therefore, it does not fit the criteria for ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer and is best classified as Ambiguous due to its focus on traditional software engineering and data processing."
