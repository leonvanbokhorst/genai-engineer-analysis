While it mentions leveraging AI and generative AI, the core responsibilities are software development and integration (Macro-Category A). The AI aspects are described as features within products (TeachTap, Coachbot) or for content generation, rather than deep model development or specialization. The technologies listed are primarily front-end and cloud-related. Therefore, the role is best classified as an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, where AI is a component of the software being built, but the primary focus remains on software engineering."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly outlines traditional software engineering responsibilities and mentions the integration of AI features into products. The technologies listed are standard for full-stack development. While 'generative AI' is mentioned, the tasks do not delve into model training, fine-tuning, or advanced prompt engineering, which would push it towards a specialist role. The confidence is high because the core duties are well-defined as software engineering, with AI as an integrated component."
