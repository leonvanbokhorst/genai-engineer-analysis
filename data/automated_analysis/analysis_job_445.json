While AI is central, the role is about using AI as a 'co-pilot' or 'booster' for software development, rather than specializing in AI model development or GenAI specific tasks like prompt engineering or RAG. The tasks described fall predominantly under Macro-Category A (Core Software Engineering), with AI being the enhancement, fitting the 'AI-Adjacent Software Engineer' profile."

        "reasoning": "The job ad clearly emphasizes software development and the integration of AI into those processes. It explicitly states AI is a 'co-pilot' and 'booster' for coding and development, rather than the core focus of model building. The absence of specific GenAI technologies or deep ML tasks supports the classification. The confidence is high, but not a perfect 5, as the phrasing is somewhat aspirational and less granular on specific technical implementations of AI within the software development lifecycle."
