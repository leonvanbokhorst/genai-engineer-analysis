        "Functieomschrijving": "Content marketing platforms are facing unprecedented challenges: scaling content creation, optimizing for ever-changing data, and improving ROI are harder than ever. Despite the promise of AI, many solutions out there only scratch the surface, offering generic models that don't quite address the complex needs of content marketing teams. This means wasted time, underutilized resources, and missed growth opportunities for enterprises.\n\n   At Contently, we're going beyond basic automation, using cutting-edge AI to solve deeply complex problems specific to content marketing, like how to intelligently recommend content, personalize campaigns, and boost engagement using LLMs. In this role, you will explore and implement AI solutions that directly change how global brands create, optimize, and measure their content strategies. It's not just about developing features; it's about transforming an industry.\n\n   This role is tailor-made for someone who craves technical challenge. You'll not only be building end-to-end AI solutions-from writing custom algorithms and integrating machine learning models to deploying scalable cloud-based services-but you'll also have the freedom to experiment with the latest AI technologies. You'll have access to vast datasets, the freedom to iterate fast, and a direct line to see the impact your work has on real users. If you're the kind of engineer who loves to experiment, push boundaries, and innovate in a way that directly impacts product direction, this is the opportunity you've been waiting for.\n\n   Join our team, where every line of code you write contributes to reshaping an industry. You'll work alongside experts in AI, design, and product management, ensuring your innovations translate into features that make a measurable difference for users. If this sounds like your kind of challenge, we want to hear from you.\n\n   What you will be doing\n\n     * Developing and implementing AI-driven features and tools to enhance our content marketing platform\n     * Conducting experiments and exploring new AI technologies, including LLMs, to identify potential applications for Contently, * Develop AI-powered applications to reduce operational costs",
