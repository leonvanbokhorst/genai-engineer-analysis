While it mentions catering to LLM applications, it does not detail specific generative AI tasks like fine-tuning, RAG, or advanced prompt engineering. The core responsibilities align more with traditional backend development and MLOps infrastructure rather than the direct development or adaptation of generative models themselves. Therefore, it doesn't fit the 'GenAI Engineer' or 'ML Engineer' profiles."
