While the products are AI-powered (\"Harnesses AI\", \"AI-generated videos\"), the engineer's responsibilities do not involve the development, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or specialized data handling for these AI models. Instead, the role is about integrating and managing these AI features within the software product. This aligns with the definition of an AI-Adjacent Software Engineer, where the engineer builds or maintains software that directly uses or supports AI/ML models as a core part of its functionality, and the output is an AI-powered feature or system."

This alignment makes the classification straightforward."
