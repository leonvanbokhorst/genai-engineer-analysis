            "rationale": "The job description is for a Front End Developer and primarily focuses on traditional software development tasks using a modern web stack (Vite, React, SCSS, Node.JS). While it mentions using AI to enhance work and knowledge, it does not involve the core responsibilities of building, fine-tuning, or deploying AI models, nor does it focus on data engineering or advanced modeling techniques. The role is more about leveraging AI tools for productivity rather than developing AI systems themselves, fitting the 'Ambiguous' profile as it's not a technical AI role."
