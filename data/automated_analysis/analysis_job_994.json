            "rationale": "The job description focuses on providing human feedback to train AI models by crafting and answering questions, and evaluating AI-generated code. While it mentions 'generative AI models' and 'large language models', it does not involve core engineering tasks like building, fine-tuning, or deploying these models. The role is more about human-in-the-loop data annotation and evaluation for AI training rather than AI development or engineering. It lacks the technical depth and core responsibilities of an ML Engineer or GenAI Engineer as defined in the coding book, leaning towards the use of AI tools for a specific task rather than building AI systems."
