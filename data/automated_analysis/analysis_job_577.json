While 'Machine Learning Engineer' is in the title, the core responsibilities and technologies mentioned, particularly the focus on LLMs and NLP, align more closely with the 'GenAI Engineer' profile. The mention of MLOps and model lifecycle management is common to both, but the specific application of generative models is a key differentiator."
