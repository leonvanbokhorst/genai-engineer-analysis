# GenAI Engineer Coding Book

## Guiding Principles for Analysis

1.  **Semantic, Not Keyword-Based:** The primary instruction for analysis is to use semantic understanding. Classification should be based on how well the text of a job ad aligns with the **Definition** of a category, not on matching specific keywords.
2.  **Multilingual & Mixed-Language Aware:** The analysis must be language-agnostic. The definitions apply to concepts whether they are expressed in English, Dutch, or (most commonly) a mix of Dutch communication with English technical terms.
3.  **Examples are Illustrative:** The `Example Phrases` provided are not a checklist. They are intended to give a flavor of the type of language that might be encountered and to aid in understanding the _intent_ of the category definition.

## 1. Job Task Categories

### Rationale for a Two-Tiered Categorization

To rigorously test the hypothesis that the GenAI Engineer is fundamentally a software engineering role augmented with AI-specific skills, we are adopting a two-tiered categorization system. This approach differs from the original paper's CAIN2022 (2022 Heck et al.) flat list of categories by explicitly grouping tasks into **Core Software Engineering** and **AI Specialization**.

This structure allows us to quantitatively analyze the job market's emphasis. If the "software engineering first" hypothesis is correct, we expect to see a significantly higher frequency of coded phrases within the _Core Software Engineering_ macro-category. This methodological decision enables a more nuanced analysis, directly addressing a central question about the nature of the GenAI Engineer profession.

The following detailed sub-categories provide the necessary granularity for accurate coding, while the two primary macro-categories frame our analysis. `Business Understanding` is kept separate as it represents a general professional skill applicable across senior technical roles.

### Job Profiles

Based on the distribution of tasks between the two macro-categories, each job ad will be assigned one of the following profiles. The distinction between `GenAI` and `ML` engineer is critical.

- **`Core GenAI Engineer`**: A balanced mix of tasks from `Macro-Category A` and `B`. Critically, the tasks and technologies are focused on **Generative AI** (e.g., LLMs, RAG, LangChain, prompt engineering, diffusion models).
- **`Core ML Engineer`**: A balanced mix of tasks from `Macro-Category A` and `B`. The tasks and technologies are focused on **traditional Machine Learning** (e.g., predictive modeling, classification, regression, computer vision) and do not significantly involve generative models.
- **`AI-Adjacent Software Engineer`**: Tasks are predominantly from `Macro-Category A`. The role builds or maintains software that directly uses or supports AI/ML models as a core part of its functionality. The output of their work is an AI-powered feature or system.
- **`Software Engineer`**: Tasks are exclusively from `Macro-Category A`. The role does not involve building or integrating AI models. The job may mention AI-assisted tools for productivity, but the final product is not an AI-powered system.
- **`GenAI Specialist`**: Tasks are predominantly from `Macro-Category B` and are focused on **Generative AI**.
- **`ML Specialist (Data Scientist)`**: Tasks are predominantly from `Macro-Category B` and are focused on **traditional Machine Learning**.
- **`Not Relevant`**: The job ad shows no significant tasks related to either `Core Software Engineering` or `GenAI Specialization`. It is likely an unrelated role (e.g., sales, marketing, traditional data analysis) that may have been caught by broad keyword searches.
