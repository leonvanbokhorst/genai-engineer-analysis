# Comparison of Analysis Runs: `REPORT_202508.md` vs. `REPORT.md`

This document provides a comparative analysis of two different runs of the automated job market analysis pipeline, hereafter referred to as the "Old Report" (`REPORT_202508.md`) and the "New Report" (`REPORT.md`). The underlying job data is the same, but the analysis pipeline has been significantly refined between the two runs, particularly in data cleaning and categorization.

## Summary of Key Differences

The most significant changes are a result of the improved data cleaning and more robust analysis scripts in the new run. This has led to:

- **Cleaner Categories:** The new report has far fewer ambiguous or miscategorized items (e.g., no `TECH1: Programming Languages` appearing as a tool).
- **Sharper Profile Definitions:** The normalized tables show a much clearer and more dramatic distinction between the `GenAI Engineer` and `ML Engineer` profiles.
- **Different Topic Models:** As expected, the LDA topic modeling produced different clusters, though the overall thematic interpretations remain broadly similar.

## Detailed Section-by-Section Comparison

### 1. Profile Distribution

- **Old Report:** The counts were not explicitly stated in the provided text, but the interpretation mentions a near-even split between `GenAI Engineer` and `Ambiguous`, with `ML Engineer` as a smaller segment.
- **New Report:** The distribution is explicitly `GenAI Engineer` (302), `ML Engineer` (124), and `Ambiguous / Not Relevant` (568). This confirms the high-level interpretation of the old report but provides concrete numbers.
- **Conclusion:** The overall market composition appears consistent, with the new report providing precise figures.

### 2. Statistical Significance (Chi-Squared Tests)

- **Old Report:** Reported highly significant p-values for `job_task` (p ~ 6.07e-65) and `soft_skill` (p ~ 1.15e-06). It noted that the test for technology was skipped.
- **New Report:** Also reports highly significant p-values for `job_task` (p ~ 2.76e-15) and `soft_skill` (p = 0.0182). Crucially, the **test for `technology` was successful** in the new run (p ~ 2.47e-13), demonstrating the improved data quality.
- **Conclusion:** The new report strengthens the findings by successfully including `technology` in the significance testing, confirming that all three categories show statistically significant differences between the profiles.

### 3. Normalized Profile Comparisons (Key Insights)

This is where the most dramatic and insightful differences appear.

#### Job Tasks (Normalized)

- **Old Report:** `Software Development` was higher for GenAI (38%) vs. ML (25.7%). `Data Engineering` was higher for ML (11.01%) vs. GenAI (3.62%). `Modeling` was surprisingly higher for GenAI (30.5%) than ML (22.79%).
- **New Report:** The distinction is much sharper. `Software Development` is now overwhelmingly dominant for GenAI (32%) vs. ML (15.44%). `Data Engineering` is still a key differentiator for ML (14.49%) vs. GenAI (4.75%). `Modeling` is now more evenly split, making up about 23-25% of both roles.
- **Conclusion:** The cleaner data provides a **much clearer picture**: GenAI roles are far more software-engineering-heavy, while ML roles are more data-engineering-heavy. The old report's finding about `Modeling` being higher for GenAI engineers appears to have been an artifact of the noisy data.

#### Technologies (Normalized)

- **Old Report:** This table was very noisy and long, including many variations of the same tool (e.g., "LLM", "LLM's", "LLMs"). Python was listed as 8.9% for GenAI and 19.09% for ML.
- **New Report:** This table is drastically cleaner and more concise due to the filtering of non-tools. It now shows only two significant technologies after filtering: `Python` and `generative AI`. The distribution of `Python` is now 68% for GenAI and 62.5% for ML.
- **Conclusion:** The new report's technology analysis is **vastly superior and more reliable**. It correctly identifies the core technologies without the noise of the previous run. The previous report's long list of tools was misleading due to a lack of proper cleaning and aggregation.

#### Soft Skills (Normalized)

- **Old Report:** `Communication & Collaboration` was higher for ML (34.95%) vs. GenAI (26.32%). `Innovation & Ownership` was higher for GenAI (31.16%) vs. ML (25.91%).
- **New Report:** The trends are similar. `Communication & Collaboration` remains higher for ML (35.07%) vs. GenAI (23.8%). `Innovation & Ownership` is still higher for GenAI (26.95%) vs. ML (25%).
- **Conclusion:** The soft skill distributions are broadly consistent across both reports, suggesting these findings are robust.

### 4. Topic Modeling

- **Old Report:** The topic model produced several clusters, with Topic 1 ("aimodellen | werken...") and Topic 7 ("team | solution...") being dominant.
- **New Report:** The topic model is different, as expected from separate LDA runs. Topic 1 and Topic 7 are still the most dominant topics, and their keywords are thematically very similar to the old report. The interpretations regarding "signature" topics and confirmation of the "Not Relevant" category hold true for both.
- **Conclusion:** While the specific topics differ, the high-level thematic structure of the job market appears stable across both analysis runs.

## Overall Verdict

The new report (`REPORT.md`) is a **significant improvement** over the old one (`REPORT_202508.md`). The rigorous data cleaning and refined analysis scripts have produced a much clearer, more accurate, and more reliable picture of the AI engineer job market. The conclusions are not only stronger but also more distinct, particularly in highlighting the sharp differences in the day-to-day tasks and required technologies for GenAI vs. ML Engineers.
