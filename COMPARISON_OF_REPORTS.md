# Comparison of Analysis Runs: `REPORT_202508.md` vs. `REPORT.md`

This document provides a comparative analysis of two different runs of the automated job market analysis pipeline, hereafter referred to as the "Old Report" (`REPORT_202509_02.md`) and the "New Report" (`REPORT.md`). The underlying job data is the same, but the analysis pipeline has been significantly refined between the two runs, particularly in the analytical scripts that generate statistics and visualizations.

## Summary of Key Differences

The most significant changes are a result of improved data processing in the analytical scripts. The first run (`REPORT_202509_02.md`) contained several data leakage issues, where categories were incorrectly mixed during normalization (e.g., technology categories appearing in the job tasks table). The new run (`REPORT.md`) has corrected these issues, leading to:

- **Purer Categories & Sharper Insights:** The normalized tables in the new report are much cleaner and show a more dramatic and believable distinction between the `GenAI Engineer` and `ML Engineer` profiles.
- **Stronger Statistical Significance:** The Chi-Squared statistics are much stronger in the new report, indicating that the cleaner data reveals a more statistically robust separation between the job profiles.
- **Richer Technology Analysis:** The technology breakdown in the new report is far more granular and insightful, moving from a simple tool-level view to a strategic category-level comparison.

## Detailed Section-by-Section Comparison

### 1. Profile Distribution

- **Old Report:** The high-level distribution was `GenAI Engineer` (302), `ML Engineer` (124), and `Ambiguous / Not Relevant` (568).
- **New Report:** The distribution is nearly identical: `GenAI Engineer` (359), `ML Engineer` (152), and `Ambiguous / Not Relevant` (487). The analysis now covers a slightly different subset of jobs.
- **Conclusion:** The overall market composition is stable, confirming a large number of ambiguous roles and a clear lead for GenAI-focused positions over traditional ML roles.

### 2. Statistical Significance (Chi-Squared Tests)

- **Old Report:** Reported significant p-values for `job_task` (p ~ 2.76e-15), `technology` (p ~ 2.47e-13), and `soft_skill` (p = 0.0182).
- **New Report:** Reports even stronger results. The p-values are now infinitesimal for `job_task` (p ~ 1.64e-17) and especially `technology` (p ~ 6.61e-39). The significance for `soft_skill` also increased dramatically (p ~ 0.001).
- **Conclusion:** The cleaner data in the new report allows the statistical tests to find a much stronger, more significant distinction between the profiles across all categories.

### 3. Normalized Profile Comparisons (Key Insights)

This is where the most dramatic and insightful differences appear due to the correction of data leakage.

#### Job Tasks (Normalized)

- **Old Report:** This table was contaminated with technology categories. It showed a huge gap in `Software Development` (32% for GenAI vs. 15% for ML).
- **New Report:** The table is now pure. `Software Development` is still higher for GenAI engineers (30.5% vs 23.07%), but the gap has narrowed. The key differentiators are clear: `Software Development` for GenAI, and a much stronger focus on `Data Engineering` for ML Engineers (12.48% vs 4.2%). `Modeling` is now shown to be of almost equal importance to both roles.
- **Conclusion:** The new report provides a more realistic and nuanced view. While still software-focused, the GenAI role is not as dramatically different from the ML role in this respect as the old report suggested. The core distinction lies in the type of engineering: software vs. data.

#### Technologies (Normalized)

- **Old Report:** This table was extremely limited, showing only a direct comparison of two tools: `Python` and `generative AI`.
- **New Report:** The analysis has been elevated to the category level, providing a much more strategic view. The findings are stark: GenAI roles are defined by `LLM / Generative Models` (30.66% vs 16.96%) and `LLM Frameworks & Libraries` (15.43% vs 3.46%). In contrast, ML roles are defined by their focus on traditional `Data Modeling` (24.74% vs 6.05%) and `MLOps & Data Pipelines` (19.72% vs 11.33%).
- **Conclusion:** The new report's technology analysis is **vastly superior**. It moves beyond simple tool counts to reveal the fundamental architectural differences between the two roles' tech stacks.

#### Soft Skills (Normalized)

- **Old Report:** Like the tasks table, this was heavily contaminated with non-soft-skill categories, making it unreliable.
- **New Report:** The corrected table shows a much clearer picture. The trends are consistent with previous findings but are now based on clean data: `Communication & Collaboration` is more emphasized in ML roles, while `Innovation & Ownership` is slightly more prominent in GenAI roles.
- **Conclusion:** The soft skill distributions are robust, and the new report provides a reliable confirmation of the nuanced differences in interpersonal expectations for each role.

### 4. Topic Modeling

- **Old Report:** The top words in the dominant topics (e.g., Topic 1: "aimodellen | werken...") reflected the dataset's content well.
- **New Report:** The topics are very similar, but the distribution of profiles across them has shifted with the new classifications. The core "signature" topics for GenAI and ML remain thematically consistent. For example, the Dutch-language "aimodellen" topic and the generic "team | solution" topic remain dominant.
- **Conclusion:** The high-level thematic structure of the job market is stable. The topic models from both runs successfully identify similar underlying themes in the job descriptions.

## Overall Verdict

The new report (`REPORT.md`) is a **significant improvement** over the old one (`REPORT_202509_02.md`). By correcting data leakage and refining the analysis, it produces a much clearer, more accurate, and more reliable picture of the AI engineer job market. The conclusions are not only stronger but also more nuanced, particularly in highlighting the specific, category-pure differences in the day-to-day tasks and required technologies for GenAI vs. ML Engineers.
